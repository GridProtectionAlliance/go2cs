When converting all projects from "A Tour of Go" tutorial, these were the big takeaways:

>> basics

07-named-results

    Named tuple variables are available as locals to function and once
    assigned allow a naked return.

08-variables

    Locals in Go do not require initialization - during conversion variables
    will need to be initialized like "int i = default;".

11-basic-types

    Literals are arbitrary-precision numbers until assigned to a variable.

13-type-conversions

    Since Go requires a cast even for simple numeric types, applying equivalent
    cast in C# is simple even if redundant in some cases.

14-type-inference

    Will need to be careful that type checks work as expected. Need to make sure
    equivalent Go types return the same names as Go via "fmt". General type
    inference in C# works using the "var" declarator. Go is more flexible about
    location of var types though, e.g., use outside function. In these cases the
    conversion process will need to infer proper type. Literals will be fairy
    simple, but some type of expression evaluation will be required.

15-constants

    First: Go allows inferred type constants. C# does not support "var" outside
    local functions - the right solution seems to be infer desired type during
    conversion process through expression evaluation - could get a little tricky.
    One cheaper    solution might be to compile Go code and attempt to infer
    constant value that    way, adding console output for answer for example. If
    conversion state is good enough this won't be necessary.

    Second: Console apps wanting to display Unicode foreign language symbols need
    to (a) use a font that supports the language, and (b) use UTF8 encoding. This
    could become important for running Go unit tests and comparing console outputs
    from converted code.

16-numeric-constants

    Go constants can hold arbitrary-precision literals with expression support,
    applying value to variables in Go happens at compile time, so C# conversion
    will need to support this operation. Ideally every numeric constant that can
    hold the value with overflowing should to be defined. An additional run-time
    lazy initialized BigInteger can be provided for simpler library usage but
    use of constants should be encouraged for better performance.

>> flowcontrol

09-switch

    Go switch statements to not automatically fall-through - so a "break"
    statement is not required.

10-switch-evaluation-order

    First: Each switch case is a full expression evaluation, not a constant.
    Since this deviates so far from C# switch handling, it could be better to
    use    a custom "switch class" to use during the conversion or just convert
    to if/else if expressions. A custom class would better mirror original
    code construction.

    Second: enumeration of values in Go seem to be treated as integers without
    casting like is required by C#. Conversion code will need to evaluate each
    enumeration usage to see if a cast is required.

13-defer-multi

    First: the defer command creates a stack of functions to be executed before
    function exits. A function-wrapped architecture could help here.

    Second: evaluation of lambda captures appears to happen before pushing
    lambda to the defer stack - will need to think on how to best handle this.

>> moretypes

01-pointers

    For pointer operations constrained to local stack used with fully blittable
    structures, code conversion is simple - just an "unsafe" marker and normal
    C# pointer operations. However, if a pointer ever leaves the local stack
    then its target will need heap allocation. If it's easy to detect when a
    variable leaves the stack during code conversion, then both options can
    be implemented, that is, both simple local stack pointer operations and
    operations that require heap allocation. If pointer escape analysis ends
    up being difficult, initial code conversions can always use heap-based
    pointers implementations any time a variable address is taken.

05-struct-literals

    Pointers to member level variables are going to be problematic from a C#
    perspective    as these would need to be a stack allocated    pinned pointer to
    the shared member variable. For Go every thing is a simple struct until it
    needs heap allocation outside of the local stack, even passing a parameter
    to a function by reference happens using pointers in Go. It seems like Go
    pointers are more like C# class references.    A simple heap allocation class
    wrapper like "ptr<T>" should suffice for Go pointer functionality.

    Member variables in C# cannot be declared with var for implicit typing, so
    conversion tool will need to type expressions on the fly. A simple utility
    written in Go that would parse and evaluate the member types might be handy
    for this operation, otherwise, a Roslyn based expression parser would work
    post conversion of expression to C#.

08-slice-pointers

    Arrays and slices in Go act differently than in C#, so this functionality
    will need to be replicated with custom array / slice classes.

    Go array lengths are validated at compile-time - I do not currently see a 
    need for this same validation in C#, especially if a prerequisite for
    converting code is that it already compiles in Go.

09-slice-literals

    In Go a struct can be declared inline, C# does not support this so these
    dynamic structure elements will need to be named and declared external to
    the function. Suggest at least internal if private cannot be accommodated.
    Example shows how clean primary code can remain with some back-side
    helper functions.

    If multiple identical dynamic structures are defined for a static class
    conversion will need to map to the same    structure in order to use the
    tuple-based construction helper functions. This means a per-class local
    dictionary of defined types. Need to see if these dynamic structure types
    can also support local extension functions.

    Testing will need to be done with scoped variables with the same name, each
    C# per static class local structure will need an index for uniqueness.

    Additionally, C# does not allow a bool as blittable value. In Go the bool
    is the same size as a byte, so the golib defines a @bool type structure that
    is implicitly castable to C# bool that can be used in structures or type
    definitions. Blittable types are required or GCHandle allocations and
    pointer operations.

    For tuple based inputs with @bool, boolean source fields will need to be
    declared as standard C# bool for proper literal parsing.

17-range-continued

    The shift value in bit-shift operators will need to be cast to (int) as this
    is what C# expects - even operator overload requires it.

19-maps-pointerstyle(1 & 2)

    This is not part of the official tour, but curiosity got the best of me
    wondering about pointers - so after emerging from the rabbit hole (having
    went deeper than I meant to go) I learned two things (1) Go pointers have
    more unconstrained usage than in C#, (2) pointers in Go often match "ref"
    operations in C# for structs, as such, this should be the preferred method
    of handling pointers during conversions. However, "ref" only works for stack
    allocated structures, so a class based reference wrapper will be required
    anytime a structure needs to "leave the stack". Since the very moment a
    structure "leaves the stack" a copy of the structure will be made, careful
    handling will be required for interactions happening with local structs, i.e.,
    pointers to local structs that leave the scope of the local functions will
    need to be wrapped - careful, there be dragons that live here...

    From a high level, Go seems to use pointers like C# uses reference classes,
    but in Go there is no clear delineation of class vs a struct like there is
    in C#. In Go every struct looks and acts like a C# struct and, as a Go coder,
    you    don't seem to have any awareness (er, need of awareness) of all the memory
    management operations that are happening behind the scenes on your behalf.

    Note 1: Go dereferenced pointer operations should always be wrapped in C# for
    proper compilation, for example:
        Go *val++ => C# (*val)++;

    Note 2: Any time a local variable has an address-of operator applied to it
    in a Go function, C# conversion should create a heap-based wrapper for the
    type and dereference variable local to function using C# "ref", e.g.:

        var p__v1 = ptr(new Vertex(
            40.68433, -74.39967
        ));

        ref var v1 = ref p__v1.Value;

    Note 3: Stylistically there a few ways to support dereferenced pointer
    variables in converted code, for example:

        /* Original: */ m["Bell Labs"].Lat = 1000

        /* Option 1: */ m["Bell Labs"].Value.Lat = 1000;          // ref T Value
        /* Option 2: */ ((Vertex*)m["Bell Labs"])->Lat = 1000;    // implicit conversion to T* (unsafe only)
        /* Option 3: */ (~m["Bell Labs"])->Lat = 1000;            // bitwise complement operator to T* (unsafe only)

        The nice thing about option 1 is (a) looks closer to Go code, (b) code
        does not require unsafe markers, and (c) it may be slightly faster to
        access property vs an operator function.

22-mutating-maps

    To handle the optional return tuple pattern, a constant like "WithOK" set to false
    can produce an indexer overload to handle the use case:

        // Source with tuple return pattern
        public (TValue, bool) this[TKey key, bool _] => ...

        // Example usage
        var (v, ok) = m["Answer", WithOK];

>> methods

03-methods-continued

    The C# using alias is ideal for simple Go type extensions, especially since
    C# does not support type inheritance. That said, this now creates a need for
    a reference    log to know every time the new type is used. Each time aliased
    type is referenced in a source code file it will need to be added to the
    using section at the top of the source code file:

        using MyFloat = System.Double;

    Speaking of which, this may be an excellent way to handle direct native Go
    equivalents instead of a wrapped implicitly cast structure type:

        using int32 = System.Int32;
        using int64 = System.Int64;

    Should we bother with support for 32-bits?

    #if Target32Bit
        using @int = System.Int32;
        using @uint = System.UInt32;
    #else
        using @int = System.Int64;
        using @uint = System.UInt64;
    #endif

    Could just opt for 64-bit only and use C# long/ulong for every Go int/uint


06-indirection

    One thing to note when creating a direct pointer variable in a local function,
    e.g., from Go "p := &Vertex{4, 3}" to C# "var p = ptr(new Vertex(4, 3));", is
    that any time the variable is used with the function the "Value" of the pointer
    needs to be assumed to be the target of "p" unless the destination is a ptr<T>.

    This gets explained in methods tour step 7. Given pointer "p", the method call
    to "p.Abs()" is interpreted as "(*p).Abs()".

09-interfaces

    Implementing interfaces in C# the Go way, that is, based on duck-typing via
    extension methods, is hard, but not impossible.
    
    One could imagine some kind of preprocessing during the conversion process where
    all extension methods encountered could be actually implemented as part of the
    target type. This would certainly work for many types and in many cases, but in
    Go the duck typed implementation can happen at any time - this works much more
    like a .NET extension function such that the type can be extended by other
    libraries later and the source type not need to be compiled with all known types.
    
    Also, based on prior C# aliasing technique, an extension method would still work
    but a native type cannot be extended to implement an interface without creating
    a new derived type. As such extension methods seems to be the best fit. Using
    conventional methods this will depend on reflecting types at runtime, but the
    results can be statically cached so that the performance hit will only happen
    once during initialization, i.e., first time when casting a type to an interface.

    This can all happen with a behind the scenes with a class wrapper that will take
    either the type (T) or a pointer to the type, i.e., ptr<T>, for the interface.
    Unfortunately C# does not allow implicit type conversions with interfaces as
    parameters (guess this makes sense as type already implements interface), so
    we will need a static cast function whenever a type is converted to the
    interface class wrapper which will lookup needed interface methods for given
    type during static type initialization - like an "As<T>" function, e.g.:

    >> Go code:

        var a Abser
        f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
        v := Vertex{3, 4}

        a = f  // a MyFloat implements Abser
        a = &v // a *Vertex implements Abser

    >> C# equivalent:

        Abser a;
        var f = (MyFloat)(-math.Sqrt2);
        var _v_ptr = ptr(new Vertex(3, 4));  // Have to heap allocate v, it's pointer address is used later
        ref var v = ref _v_ptr.Value;

        a = Abser.As(f);      // a MyFloat implements Abser
        a = Abser.As(_v_ptr); // a *Vertex implements Abser

14-empty-interface

    The empty interface in Go acts like the object class in .NET. For all intents and
    purposes, every Go "interface{}" should be easily replaced with .NET "object". The
    other option is creating a full set of Go types that all inherit something like
    an "IEmptyInterface". Creating a full set of types for all Go native types might
    work for most cases, but the compiled code would lose native value optimizations
    that come at an IL level since all interactions with Go equivalent .NET native
    types would need to be cast to and from C# native types via operator functions.
    Going to try just using .NET "object" class for encountered "interface {}" types.

15-type-assertions

    Hoping that this functionality will be easy to map since .NET already has strong
    type handling. One interesting thing is that functions used to handle Go-like type
    assertions can actually just be an underscore with a generic type, as a single
    underscore is a valid function name. I think a function name like this would
    generally be discouraged, but in this case it produces C# code that is very
    visually similar to original Go code, for example:

    >> Go code:

        package main

        import "fmt"

        func main() {
            var i interface{} = "hello"

            s := i.(string)
            fmt.Println(s)

            s, ok := i.(string)
            fmt.Println(s, ok)

            f, ok := i.(float64)
            fmt.Println(f, ok)

            f = i.(float64) // panic
            fmt.Println(f)
        }

    >> C# equivalent:

        using fmt = go.fmt_package;
        using static go.builtin;
        using float64 = System.Double;

        class main_package
        {
            static void Main() {
                object i = "hello";

                string s = i._<string>();
                fmt.Println(s);

                bool ok;
                (s, ok) = i._<string>(WithOK);
                fmt.Println(s, ok);

                float64 f;
                (f, ok) = i._<float64>(WithOK);
                fmt.Println(f, ok);

                f = i._<float64>(); // panic
                fmt.Println(f, ok);
            }
        }

21-reader

    When determining function accessibility of a Go type extension, if the target
    of the extension is private, then the function should be private.

>> concurrency

04-range-and-close

    Right hand operands are fully evaluated before assignment to left hand
    operands. Consider the following in Go:

            x, y = y, x+y

    The equivalent in C# is as follows

            var _y1 = x+y;
            x = y;
            y = _y1;
