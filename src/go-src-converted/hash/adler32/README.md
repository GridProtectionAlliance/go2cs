Package adler32 implements the Adler-32 checksum.

It is defined in RFC 1950:

	Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is
	the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values. Both sums
	are done modulo 65521. s1 is initialized to 1, s2 to zero.  The
	Adler-32 checksum is stored as s2*65536 + s1 in most-
	significant-byte first (network) order.
