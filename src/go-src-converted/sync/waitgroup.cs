// go2cs NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION (hand-owned; replaces the converted waitgroup.go output). Go's WaitGroup
// packs a counter and a waiter count into one atomic uint64 and parks waiters on the runtime sleeping
// semaphore — the same primitive that cannot be faithfully emulated (see mutex.cs / runtime_impl.cs).
// Reimplemented natively: a guarded counter plus a latch event that is set whenever the counter is
// zero. Wait blocks on the latch; the Add that drives the counter to zero releases every waiter.
