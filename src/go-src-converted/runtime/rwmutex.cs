// This is a copy of sync/rwmutex.go rewritten to work in the runtime.

// A rwmutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// This is a variant of sync.RWMutex, for the runtime package.
// Like mutex, rwmutex blocks the calling M.
// It does not interact with the goroutine scheduler.
[GoType] partial struct rwmutex {
    internal mutex rLock;    // protects readers, readerPass, writer
    internal muintptr readers; // list of pending readers
    internal uint32 readerPass;   // number of pending readers to skip readers list
    internal mutex wLock;    // serializes writers
    internal muintptr writer; // pending writer waiting for completing readers

    internal atomic.Int32 readerWait; // number of departing readers

// Lock ranking an rwmutex has two aspects:
//
// Semantic ranking: this rwmutex represents some higher level lock that
// protects some resource (e.g., allocmLock protects creation of new Ms). The
// read and write locks of that resource need to be represented in the lock
// rank.
//
// Internal ranking: as an implementation detail, rwmutex uses two mutexes:
// rLock and wLock. These have lock order requirements: wLock must be locked
// before rLock. This also needs to be represented in the lock rank.
//
// Semantic ranking is represented by acquiring readRank during read lock and
// writeRank during write lock.
//
// wLock is held for the duration of a write lock, so it uses writeRank
// directly, both for semantic and internal ranking. rLock is only held
// temporarily inside the rlock/lock methods, so it uses readRankInternal to
// represent internal ranking. Semantic ranking is represented by a separate
// acquire of readRank for the duration of a read lock.
//
// The lock ranking must document this ordering:
//   - readRankInternal is a leaf lock.
//   - readRank is taken before readRankInternal.
//   - writeRank is taken before readRankInternal.
//   - readRank is placed in the lock order wherever a read lock of this rwmutex
//     belongs.
//   - writeRank is placed in the lock order wherever a write lock of this
//     rwmutex belongs.
