// Hand-finished supplement (runtime panic VALUES bridge — no Go counterpart file).
//
// Go's compiler lowers an integer division to a zero check plus a call to runtime.panicdivide(),
// which panics with runtime.divideError — a value whose dynamic type is the unexported
// runtime.errorString, and therefore satisfies runtime.Error. go2cs instead lets the CLR raise
// DivideByZeroException and maps it to a Go panic in golib (RuntimeErrorPanic.TryAsPanic), so an
// IMPLICIT division panic carried only the message text: recover()'s value failed the
// `err.(runtime.Error)` assertion that math/bits' TestDiv32PanicZero makes (Div32 divides without
// an explicit zero guard, unlike Div/Div64 which panic(divideError) themselves).
//
// golib sits UNDER this package and cannot name divideError, so the dependency is inverted: golib
// exposes the hook and the runtime registers its own canonical value here. That keeps the panic
// value identical whether it was raised explicitly by panicdivide() or implicitly by the hardware
// trap — which is exactly Go's own invariant.
//
// This file has no `<name>.go` counterpart, so a -stdlib reconvert never emits over it; the module
// marker states the ownership explicitly and matches the other hand-owned runtime files.
