// Hand-written implementations of the syscall primitives Go's RUNTIME provides rather than the
// syscall package itself (syscall.go: "Getpagesize and Exit are provided by the runtime", plus the
// runtimeSetenv/runtimeUnsetenv linknames). go2cs emits each as a bodyless `partial` method, and
// without a body here the PartialStubGenerator fills them with throwing stubs — so `syscall.Exit`
// died with "Exit: external (assembly or cgo) function is not implemented" instead of terminating
// the process. That is the last step of os.Exit, so no converted program could exit deliberately;
// it surfaced in the os/exec child-process work, where a CHILD that called os.Exit(7) reported the
// stub panic instead of its own status.
