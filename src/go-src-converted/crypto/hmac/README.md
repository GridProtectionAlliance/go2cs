Package hmac implements the Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) as defined in U.S. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 198. An HMAC is a cryptographic hash that uses a key to sign a message. The receiver verifies the hash by recomputing it using the same key.

Receivers should be careful to use Equal to compare MACs in order to avoid timing side-channels:

	// ValidMAC reports whether messageMAC is a valid HMAC tag for message.
	func ValidMAC(message, messageMAC, key []byte) bool {
		mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, key)
		mac.Write(message)
		expectedMAC := mac.Sum(nil)
		return hmac.Equal(messageMAC, expectedMAC)
	}
