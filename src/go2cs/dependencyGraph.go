// This file holds the shared package dependency graph + topological sort used to order
// conversion "least dependencies first." It is the common core of the two conversion
// drivers: StdLibConverter (convert-set = the Go standard library) and, from P2 on,
// ModuleConverter (convert-set = an end-user app + its third-party libraries). Each driver
// discovers its own node set and each node's raw imports; the graph filters edges to the
// convert-set, sorts adjacency deterministically, and produces the ordered conversion queue.
