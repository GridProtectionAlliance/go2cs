// Note: This attribute uses 'module' scope, which technically applies at the compiled module
// level. Since typical builds produce only a single module from multiple source files, this
// attribute acts effectively as a file-level marker to indicate this file has been manually
// converted from Go to C#. Multiple instances across different source files within the same
// module are allowed by the compiler without conflict, serving the intended purpose. The go2cs
// conversion tool detects this attribute by scanning the target source code file directly, thus
// identifying when to skip re-conversion. Note that actual module-level metadata stored in the
// assembly will likely serialize only a single instance of this attribute, even when multiple
// instances are defined across various files. As a result, reflection-based detection of this
// attribute only confirms that at least one file in the module was manually converted, not
// identifying individual files.
