// Hash is the common interface implemented by all hash functions.

// Hash implementations in the standard library (e.g. [hash/crc32] and
// [crypto/sha256]) implement the [encoding.BinaryMarshaler] and
// [encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler] interfaces. Marshaling a hash implementation
// allows its internal state to be saved and used for additional processing
// later, without having to re-write the data previously written to the hash.
// The hash state may contain portions of the input in its original form,
// which users are expected to handle for any possible security implications.
//
// Compatibility: Any future changes to hash or crypto packages will endeavor
// to maintain compatibility with state encoded using previous versions.
// That is, any released versions of the packages should be able to
// decode data written with any previously released version,
// subject to issues such as security fixes.
// See the Go compatibility document for background: https://golang.org/doc/go1compat
