// Package plugin implements loading and symbol resolution of Go plugins.
//
// A plugin is a Go main package with exported functions and variables that
// has been built with:
//
//	go build -buildmode=plugin
//
// When a plugin is first opened, the init functions of all packages not
// already part of the program are called. The main function is not run.
// A plugin is only initialized once, and cannot be closed.
//
// # Warnings
//
// The ability to dynamically load parts of an application during
// execution, perhaps based on user-defined configuration, may be a
// useful building block in some designs. In particular, because
// applications and dynamically loaded functions can share data
// structures directly, plugins may enable very high-performance
// integration of separate parts.
//
// However, the plugin mechanism has many significant drawbacks that
// should be considered carefully during the design. For example:
//
//   - Plugins are currently supported only on Linux, FreeBSD, and
//     macOS, making them unsuitable for applications intended to be
//     portable.
//
//   - Applications that use plugins may require careful configuration
//     to ensure that the various parts of the program be made available
//     in the correct location in the file system (or container image).
//     By contrast, deploying an application consisting of a single static
//     executable is straightforward.
//
//   - Reasoning about program initialization is more difficult when
//     some packages may not be initialized until long after the
//     application has started running.
//
//   - Bugs in applications that load plugins could be exploited by
//     an attacker to load dangerous or untrusted libraries.
//
//   - Runtime crashes are likely to occur unless all parts of the
//     program (the application and all its plugins) are compiled
//     using exactly the same version of the toolchain, the same build
//     tags, and the same values of certain flags and environment
//     variables.
//
//   - Similar crashing problems are likely to arise unless all common
//     dependencies of the application and its plugins are built from
//     exactly the same source code.
//
//   - Together, these restrictions mean that, in practice, the
//     application and its plugins must all be built together by a
//     single person or component of a system. In that case, it may
//     be simpler for that person or component to generate Go source
//     files that blank-import the desired set of plugins and then
//     compile a static executable in the usual way.
//
// For these reasons, many users decide that traditional interprocess
// communication (IPC) mechanisms such as sockets, pipes, remote
// procedure call (RPC), shared memory mappings, or file system
// operations may be more suitable despite the performance overheads.
