    // Below we compute a goal from memoryLimit. There are a few things to be aware of.
    // Firstly, the memoryLimit does not easily compare to the heap goal: the former
    // is total mapped memory by the runtime that hasn't been released, while the latter is
    // only heap object memory. Intuitively, the way we convert from one to the other is to
    // subtract everything from memoryLimit that both contributes to the memory limit (so,
    // ignore scavenged memory) and doesn't contain heap objects. This isn't quite what
    // lines up with reality, but it's a good starting point.
    //
    // In practice this computation looks like the following:
    //
    //    goal := memoryLimit - ((mappedReady - heapFree - heapAlloc) + max(mappedReady - memoryLimit, 0))
    //                    ^1                                    ^2
    //    goal -= goal / 100 * memoryLimitHeapGoalHeadroomPercent
    //    ^3
    //
    // Let's break this down.
    //
    // The first term (marker 1) is everything that contributes to the memory limit and isn't
    // or couldn't become heap objects. It represents, broadly speaking, non-heap overheads.
    // One oddity you may have noticed is that we also subtract out heapFree, i.e. unscavenged
    // memory that may contain heap objects in the future.
    //
    // Let's take a step back. In an ideal world, this term would look something like just
    // the heap goal. That is, we "reserve" enough space for the heap to grow to the heap
    // goal, and subtract out everything else. This is of course impossible; the definition
    // is circular! However, this impossible definition contains a key insight: the amount
    // we're *going* to use matters just as much as whatever we're currently using.
    //
    // Consider if the heap shrinks to 1/10th its size, leaving behind lots of free and
    // unscavenged memory. mappedReady - heapAlloc will be quite large, because of that free
    // and unscavenged memory, pushing the goal down significantly.
    //
    // heapFree is also safe to exclude from the memory limit because in the steady-state, it's
    // just a pool of memory for future heap allocations, and making new allocations from heapFree
    // memory doesn't increase overall memory use. In transient states, the scavenger and the
    // allocator actively manage the pool of heapFree memory to maintain the memory limit.
    //
    // The second term (marker 2) is the amount of memory we've exceeded the limit by, and is
    // intended to help recover from such a situation. By pushing the heap goal down, we also
    // push the trigger down, triggering and finishing a GC sooner in order to make room for
    // other memory sources. Note that since we're effectively reducing the heap goal by X bytes,
    // we're actually giving more than X bytes of headroom back, because the heap goal is in
    // terms of heap objects, but it takes more than X bytes (e.g. due to fragmentation) to store
    // X bytes worth of objects.
    //
    // The final adjustment (marker 3) reduces the maximum possible memory limit heap goal by
    // memoryLimitHeapGoalPercent. As the name implies, this is to provide additional headroom in
    // the face of pacing inaccuracies, and also to leave a buffer of unscavenged memory so the
    // allocator isn't constantly scavenging. The reduction amount also has a fixed minimum
    // (memoryLimitMinHeapGoalHeadroom, not pictured) because the aforementioned pacing inaccuracies
    // disproportionately affect small heaps: as heaps get smaller, the pacer's inputs get fuzzier.
