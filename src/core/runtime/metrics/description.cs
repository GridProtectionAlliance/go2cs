    // starts with a /, and a machine-parseable unit. The name may contain any valid Unicode
    // codepoint in between / characters, but by convention will try to stick to lowercase
    // characters and hyphens. An example of such a path might be "/memory/heap/free".
    //
    // The unit is by convention a series of lowercase English unit names (singular or plural)
    // without prefixes delimited by '*' or '/'. The unit names may contain any valid Unicode
    // codepoint that is not a delimiter.
    // Examples of units might be "seconds", "bytes", "bytes/second", "cpu-seconds",
    // "byte*cpu-seconds", and "bytes/second/second".
    //
    // For histograms, multiple units may apply. For instance, the units of the buckets and
    // the count. By convention, for histograms, the units of the count are always "samples"
    // with the type of sample evident by the metric's name, while the unit in the name
    // specifies the buckets' unit.
    //
    // A complete name might look like "/memory/heap/free:bytes".
