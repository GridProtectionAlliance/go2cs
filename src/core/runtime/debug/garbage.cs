// is ready to run but all the existing threads are blocked in system calls, cgo calls,
// or are locked to other goroutines due to use of runtime.LockOSThread.

// manipulation of memory may cause faults at non-nil addresses in less
// dramatic situations; SetPanicOnFault allows such programs to request
// that the runtime trigger only a panic, not a crash.
// The runtime.Error that the runtime panics with may have an additional method:
//
//	Addr() uintptr
//
// If that method exists, it returns the memory address which triggered the fault.
// The results of Addr are best-effort and the veracity of the result

// SetTraceback sets the amount of detail printed by the runtime in

// environment variable. For example, SetTraceback("all") ensure
// that the program prints all goroutines when it crashes.

// SetMemoryLimit provides the runtime with a soft memory limit.
//
// The runtime undertakes several processes to try to respect this
// memory limit, including adjustments to the frequency of garbage
// collections and returning memory to the underlying system more
// aggressively. This limit will be respected even if GOGC=off (or,
// if SetGCPercent(-1) is executed).
//
// The input limit is provided as bytes, and includes all memory
// mapped, managed, and not released by the Go runtime. Notably, it
// does not account for space used by the Go binary and memory
// external to Go, such as memory managed by the underlying system
// on behalf of the process, or memory managed by non-Go code inside
// the same process. Examples of excluded memory sources include: OS
// kernel memory held on behalf of the process, memory allocated by
// C code, and memory mapped by syscall.Mmap (because it is not
// managed by the Go runtime).
//
// More specifically, the following expression accurately reflects
// the value the runtime attempts to maintain as the limit:
//
//	runtime.MemStats.Sys - runtime.MemStats.HeapReleased
//
// or in terms of the runtime/metrics package:
//
//	/memory/classes/total:bytes - /memory/classes/heap/released:bytes
//
// A zero limit or a limit that's lower than the amount of memory
// used by the Go runtime may cause the garbage collector to run
// nearly continuously. However, the application may still make
// progress.
//
// The memory limit is always respected by the Go runtime, so to
// effectively disable this behavior, set the limit very high.
// [math.MaxInt64] is the canonical value for disabling the limit,
// but values much greater than the available memory on the underlying
// system work just as well.
//
// See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide for a detailed guide explaining
// the soft memory limit in more detail, as well as a variety of common
// use-cases and scenarios.
//
// The initial setting is math.MaxInt64 unless the GOMEMLIMIT
// environment variable is set, in which case it provides the initial
// setting. GOMEMLIMIT is a numeric value in bytes with an optional
// unit suffix. The supported suffixes include B, KiB, MiB, GiB, and
// TiB. These suffixes represent quantities of bytes as defined by
// the IEC 80000-13 standard. That is, they are based on powers of
// two: KiB means 2^10 bytes, MiB means 2^20 bytes, and so on.
//
// SetMemoryLimit returns the previously set memory limit.
// A negative input does not adjust the limit, and allows for
// retrieval of the currently set memory limit.
