The guiding goal: the generated C# should be both *behaviorally* and *visually* similar to the
original Go, so that a Go developer can read the output and follow it. The runtime library and
the generators exist to keep the visible converted code close to the Go original.

## Package Conversion
Although a Go package more traditionally parallels a C# namespace, Go includes referenceable functions directly from within a package root, for example, the `Println` function in the `fmt` package is called like: `fmt.Println("Hello, world")`. For C#, only type declarations, e.g., `class`, `struct`, `enum`, etc., are allowed in a namespace; functions exist as part of a `class` or `struct`. Described from a C# perspective, all Go functions are [`static`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members), i.e., the functions exist separately from an instance of a type. Go supports the notion of a receiver function which allows a function to be targeted to an instance of a type (paralleling the operation of a C# extension function), but this is still a static function.

As such, the conversion strategy for a Go package is to convert it into a static C# partial class, e.g.: `public static partial class fmt_package`. Using a partial class allows all functions within separate files to be available with a single import, e.g.: `using fmt = go.fmt_package;`. The receiver functions are emitted as extension methods on that partial class (decorated with `[GoRecv]`, see [Source Generators](#source-generators)).

So that Go packages are more readily usable in C# applications, all converted code is in a root `go` namespace. Package paths are simply converted to namespaces, so a Go import like `import "unicode/utf8"` becomes a C# using like `using utf8 = go.unicode.utf8_package;`. Each package also emits a `package_info.cs` carrying a `[GoPackage]` assembly attribute plus the package-wide global `using` aliases (Go's built-in types, exported type aliases, etc.).

A consequence of converting a Go method to a C# **extension method** is that C# only discovers an extension method when its containing static class's *namespace* is in scope (via a `using <namespace>;` directive or the enclosing namespace) — a class **alias** such as `using atomic = go.@internal.runtime.atomic_package;` resolves the *type* (`atomic.Uint32`) but does **not** bring the class's extension methods into scope. This matters when a file calls a method on a value whose type comes from a multi-segment-path package (one that lands in a sub-namespace, e.g. `internal/runtime/atomic` → `go.@internal.runtime`): Go never requires importing a value's package merely to call a method on it, so such a file may emit no import — and hence no `using @internal.runtime;` — leaving the extension method invisible and the call mis-binding to a wrong (e.g. embedding-promoted) overload (CS1929). The converter therefore registers the namespace of **every cross-package method's defining package** as a file-local `using` at the call site, independent of the file's explicit imports. (Packages in the root `go` namespace — most top-level stdlib packages — need nothing extra, since same-namespace extension methods are always visible. This is a stdlib-structural concern that only surfaces under multi-segment package paths, so it is guarded by the Phase-3 `runtime` build rather than a single-package behavioral test.)

Go projects that contain a `main` function are converted into a standard C# executable project, i.e., `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>`. The conversion process can reference and convert needed external projects as library projects, i.e., `<OutputType>Library</OutputType>`, per any encountered `import` statements. In this manner an executable with packages compiled as project-referenced assemblies can be created. To create a single executable, like the original Go counterpart, a [self-contained executable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-self-contained) can be produced.

## Compiled Library versus Source Code

One big difference between Go and many other languages is the notion of _source availability_. Traditionally programming languages have depended on using a pre-compiled library — both to avoid recompiling the library and to protect source as intellectual property. Go was born in an era of faster computing and prolific open source; it relies on having access to all source at compile time, including library code. Go takes advantage of this to make interesting optimizations, especially around when a structure escapes the stack to the heap. Keeping structures off the heap means they do not need to be tracked for garbage collection, and the Go compiler manages this automatically. The interesting consequence is that, for a given use of a library as source, an application structure may or may not escape to the heap depending on how it flows through the code — an optimization only possible when all source is compiled together.

Because this is a complex optimization, the converter currently assumes structures can escape to the heap except in the simplest-to-detect cases (see [Pointers](#pointers)). A future option could distinguish optimizations targeted at a compiled library (very safe escape analysis) versus a standalone application (more aggressive). A longer-term plan is to allow already-converted packages to be referenced as compiled libraries (e.g., from NuGet), which fits the consumption model most C# developers are accustomed to; this requires a mapping from original Go package to published package reference plus an embedded manifest of each package's exported type aliases.

## Constant Values
Go constants hold arbitrary-precision literals with expression support, and assignment of a constant to a variable happens at compile time. The converter preserves the constant value (and, in a comment, the original expression). A *typed* Go constant is emitted with its concrete C# type, e.g.:

```csharp
public const nint MaxRetries = 3;
```

An *untyped* Go constant is emitted using a golib "untyped" wrapper type — `UntypedInt`, `UntypedFloat`, or `UntypedComplex` — declared `static readonly` so it can hold a value that does not fit a single primitive and can implicitly adapt to whatever numeric type its use site requires (mirroring how an untyped Go constant takes its type from context):

```csharp
internal static readonly UntypedInt win = 100;
public static readonly UntypedInt N = /* 11 + 1 */ 12;
```

A Go untyped *float* constant defaults to `float64`, so its C# literal carries the double suffix `D` — not `F` — regardless of whether the value happens to fit in `float32`. (Emitting `F` whenever the value fit would make `z := 1.0` a `float`, breaking later `float64` arithmetic with CS0266.) A literal in an explicit `float32` context keeps `F`:

```go
z := 1.0           // untyped float -> float64
var f float32 = 2.5 // float32 context
```
```csharp
var z = 1.0D;
float32 f = 2.5F;
```

A native-sized integer constant (`nint`/`nuint`, including the `uintptr` alias) whose value does not fit a C# constant of that type — e.g. `const MaxUintptr = ^uintptr(0)` (= `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`), a `ulong` literal that needs a *non-constant* `nuint` conversion — cannot be a C# `const` (CS0133/CS0266). It is emitted as `static readonly` with an `unchecked` cast instead (small native-int consts like `const nint iota = 0` stay `const`):

```csharp
public static readonly uintptr MaxUintptr = /* ^uintptr(0) */ unchecked((uintptr)18446744073709551615);
```

See [Untyped Constants and Named Numeric Types](#untyped-constants-and-named-numeric-types) for how these interact with native-int and named numeric types. See also [example](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/tree/master/src/Examples/Manual%20Tour%20of%20Go%20Conversions/basics/numeric-constants).

## Handling "int" and "uint" Types

In Go the `int` and `uint` types are sized according to the platform build target, i.e., 32-bit or 64-bit. C#'s `int`/`uint` are always 32-bit and `long`/`ulong` are always 64-bit. As of C# 9.0, native-sized integer types exist that behave exactly like their Go counterparts: [`nint` and `nuint`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#performance-and-interop). The converter maps Go `int` → `nint` and Go `uint` → `nuint`; `uintptr` also maps to `nuint`. The fixed-width Go types (`int8/16/32/64`, `uint8/16/32/64`, `byte`, `rune`) are kept as readable C# aliases of the same name (e.g. `global using uint16 = System.UInt16;`).

**Narrow-integer arithmetic.** A subtle semantic gap: Go evaluates arithmetic on a sub-`int`-width integer (`int8`/`uint8`/`int16`/`uint16`) at that operand's own width, with overflow **wrapping** — `var a, b uint8 = 200, 100; a + b` is `44` (300 mod 256). C#, however, **promotes** arithmetic on `byte`/`sbyte`/`short`/`ushort` to `int`, so `a + b` is `300` and is *not* implicitly assignable back to the narrow type. Where a narrow-arithmetic result is used in a context that requires the narrow type — e.g. passed to a narrow-typed parameter — the converter emits an explicit cast back to that type, which both compiles (the implicit `int`→narrow conversion is rejected, CS1503) and restores Go's wrapping:

```csharp
takeU8((uint8)(a + b));   // Go take(a + b), a/b uint8 → 44 (wraps), not 300
takeU8((uint8)(~a));      // Go take(^a) → 55
```

The same cast applies in the **assignment** context — a narrow-arithmetic value assigned to a narrow variable, array/slice element, or struct field (`y := a + b; y = y + 1; arr[0] = a + b; bx.b = a + b`) — and in the **declaration** context — a typed-var initializer (`var z uint8 = a + b`). All emit `(uint8)(a + b)` for the same two reasons. (A double cast is avoided when another path already narrowed the RHS, e.g. a bitwise op with an untyped constant emits its own `(byte)(b | 128)`.)

The cast is applied only when the value's Go type already matches the target (parameter / LHS / declared type), so Go accepts it without a conversion, and only for an arithmetic (binary/unary) expression — a bare identifier is already the narrow type. (Guarded by the `NarrowArithmeticArg` behavioral test, which verifies the wrapped values match Go across all four contexts. Wider integer types — `int32`/`uint32` and up — are not promoted by C# and need no cast.)

> One sticking point: not all C# indexing constructs accept a `nint`. Explicit indexers support `nint`, but [implicit index support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges#implicit-index-support) (the `Index`/`Range` syntax) currently only works with `int`, so range-operation indices are cast to `int` where needed. (The earlier strategy of compiling to `long`/`ulong`, or of custom `@int`/`@uint` structs selected by a `TARGET32BIT` directive, has been superseded by `nint`/`nuint`.)

## Untyped Constants and Named Numeric Types

This area is where Go's flexible numeric model meets C#'s stricter one, and it has a few moving parts worth calling out.

**Untyped constants.** As noted under [Constant Values](#constant-values), an untyped Go constant becomes a golib `UntypedInt`/`UntypedFloat`/`UntypedComplex`. These wrappers define implicit conversions to **and from** every numeric type so the value can slot into whatever context uses it, just like an untyped Go constant. The trade-off is that mixing an `UntypedInt` directly into heavily-typed arithmetic (e.g. `someUint64 * untypedConst`) can become ambiguous to C#'s overload resolution, since the wrapper is convertible in either direction. Context-typing of untyped *local* constants (emitting them with the concrete type their use demands instead of the wrapper) is an area of ongoing refinement.

**Named numeric types.** A Go type definition over a numeric base — `type Celsius float64`, `type level int`, `type Flags uint` — is emitted as a partial struct carrying a `num:` `[GoType]` attribute, and the `TypeGenerator` source generator fills in the body:

```csharp
[GoType("num:nint")]  partial struct level;   // type level int
[GoType("num:nuint")] partial struct Flags;   // type Flags uint
[GoType("num:float64")] partial struct Celsius; // type Celsius float64
```

The generated struct wraps the underlying value and implements the comparison and arithmetic operators plus implicit conversions to/from the underlying type, so the named type is a distinct C# type that still behaves like its base.

**Unsigned underlying types and unary minus.** Go permits unary minus on an unsigned value (it wraps: `-x == 0 - x`). C# does **not** allow the unary `-` operator on unsigned operands. So the generator's `IsUnsignedType` check *omits* the unary negation operator for unsigned underlying types (`uint8/16/32/64`, `byte`, `uintptr`, and the native `nuint`/`uint`). Go's unary minus on such a value is instead lowered by the converter to the equivalent subtraction-from-zero form:

```go
var b Flags = 2
_ = -b            // Go: unsigned unary minus (wraps)
```
```csharp
Flags b = 2;
_ = ((Flags)0 - b);   // C#: lowered to (T)0 - x
```

This keeps the generated numeric struct compilable (a `(T)(-value.m_value)` body over `nuint` is a CS0023 error) while preserving Go's wrap-around semantics. The same `(T)0 - x` lowering is used for unsigned unary minus on built-in unsigned values.

**Converting *to* a named numeric type.** The generated struct's implicit conversions are only between the named type and its *exact* underlying basic (`traceArg ↔ uint64`, `arenaIdx ↔ nuint`). So a Go conversion `traceArg(procs)` where `procs` is `int32`, or `arenaIdx(1 << b)` where the shift is `int`, has no matching operator — a plain `(traceArg)procs` is CS0030. The converter coerces the argument through the underlying type first, which is exactly Go's numeric-conversion semantics:

```go
var procs int32 = 5
a := traceArg(procs)   // type traceArg uint64
b := arenaIdx(1 << 4)  // type arenaIdx uint
```
```csharp
int32 procs = 5;
var a = ((traceArg)(uint64)procs);   // through the underlying uint64
var b = ((arenaIdx)(nuint)(1 << 4)); // through the underlying nuint
```

When the argument is *already* the underlying basic (`traceArg(u)` with `u uint64`), the existing single cast already binds, so no extra cast is inserted (no churn). (Guarded by the `NamedNumericConversion` behavioral test; runtime exercises this pervasively for `traceArg`, `arenaIdx`, `traceTime`, the `abi` offset types, etc.)

The same underlying routing applies when an untyped-constant **shift** is re-typed to a named numeric. An untyped shift `1 << k` is re-typed to the type it assumes from context (so it can combine with typed operands); when that resolved type is a *named* numeric, the re-type must go through the underlying — `(arenaIdx)((nuint)1 << k)`, not a bare `(arenaIdx)(1 << k)` (CS0030). The shift's *width* is likewise decided by the underlying (a `nuint`/`uint64`-backed named type shifts the left operand in that width to avoid the `int`-overflow seen for `1 << 63`). Non-named shifts are unchanged. (Guarded by the `NamedNumericShiftConv` behavioral test — wide `uint`/`uint64`-backed and narrow `uint8`-backed named types; runtime hits this on `arenaIdx(1 << arenaBits)`.)

The same coercion is needed where the converter itself inserts a C# `(int)` cast on a named-numeric value — a **slice bound** (`summary[sc+1:ec]` with `sc`/`ec` of type `chunkIdx`), a **shift count** (`1 << (d % 64)` with `d` of type `statDep`), or the **length of an `unsafe.Pointer`-to-array slice** (`(*[N]T)(ptr)[:n]` → `new Span<T>(ptr, (int)n)`, since the `Span<T>` constructor takes a C# `int`). A bare `(int)(sc + 1)` is CS0030 for the same reason, so the converter emits `(int)(nuint)(sc + 1)` / `(int)(nint)(d % 64)` — through the named type's underlying basic; a plain `nint`/`nuint` length is narrowed `(int)(n)`. Plain basic operands keep the bare `(int)(x)` form. (Guarded by the `NamedNumericIntCast` behavioral test; the Span length by `StdLibInternalAbi`.)

**Untyped constants in a typed-element context (`append`).** Because an untyped constant renders as a bare C# `int`/`double` literal or an `Untyped*` wrapper, passing one as an `append` element to a typed slice trips C#'s overload resolution: `append<T>(ISlice, params T[])` infers `T` from the element while the `slice<T>` overloads infer `T` from the slice, so `append([]uint16, replacementChar)` (or `append(buf, 7, 8)`) would pick `slice<int>` and fail (CS0121 / CS0029). The converter therefore casts an untyped *numeric*-constant `append` element to the slice's element type, matching Go's implicit conversion:

```go
var a []uint16
a = append(a, replacementChar)   // replacementChar is an untyped const
a = append(a, 7, 8)
```
```csharp
slice<uint16> a = default!;
a = append(a, (uint16)(replacementChar));
a = append(a, (uint16)(7), (uint16)(8));
```

Typed arguments and already-explicitly-converted elements (`uint16(r)`) are left as-is.

Relatedly, when the shifted (left) operand of a shift is an untyped constant — `1 << k` — Go gives the whole shift the type it assumes from context (e.g. `uintptr` when compared with a `uintptr`), but the bare C# literal makes the result `int`, which then cannot compare or combine with the typed operand (CS0034). The shift result is cast to its resolved type:

```go
var u uintptr = 7
_ = u < 1<<8   // 1<<8 takes type uintptr
```
```csharp
uintptr u = 7;
_ = u < (uintptr)(1 << (int)(8));
```

A related case is a **computed constant mask under a native-int bitwise operator**. `i & ((1 << shift) - 1)` or `i &^ (blockSize - 1)`, where `i` is a `uintptr`/`uint` (C# `nuint`/`uintptr`) and `shift`/`blockSize` are native-int constants: the mask is a Go compile-time constant, but because the native const is emitted as a `static readonly` (not a C# `const`) the *expression* is not a C# constant, so it renders as a bare `int` — and `nuint & int` is CS0019 (no common type, and no implicit constant conversion since the operand is non-constant). The converter casts such a computed-constant operand to the native result type — `(uintptr)i & (uintptr)((1 << (int)shift) - 1)`. A bare literal (`x & 7`) is left alone (C#'s constant conversion fits it), and a named untyped-const reference is handled by the wrapper cast below. (Guarded by the `NativeIntConstMask` behavioral test; runtime exercises this in arena/page mask arithmetic such as `arenaIndex`/`alignDown`.)

Similarly, when a *named* untyped numeric constant (emitted as the `UntypedInt`/`UntypedFloat` wrapper) is an operand of arithmetic with a concrete numeric type, the wrapper's bidirectional implicit conversions can make the result resolve to the wrong type (`a * two32`, `uint64 * UntypedInt`, yields `int` — CS0029). The named-const operand is cast to the concrete operand's type (comparisons resolve through the implicit conversion, so only arithmetic is cast):

```go
const two32 = 1 << 32
var a uint64 = 100
_ = a*two32 + 3
```
```csharp
internal static readonly UntypedInt two32 = 4294967296;
uint64 a = 100;
_ = a * (uint64)two32 + 3;
```

A constant too large for `int64`/`uint64` (or `float64`) is emitted as `GoUntyped` (= `System.Numerics.BigInteger`), which has no implicit operator with the built-in numeric types — so it is cast in *comparisons* too, not just arithmetic (`x > Two129` where `Two129 = 1<<129`):

```csharp
public static readonly GoUntyped Two129 = /* 1 << 129 */ ...;
_ = x > (float64)Two129;
```

### The `&^=` (bit-clear) compound assignment on a narrow type
C# has no `&^` (AND-NOT) operator, so Go's `a &^= b` expands to `a &= ~b`. The `~` complement always promotes its operand to `int`, and `int` is not implicitly convertible to a narrower or unsigned LHS type (`byte`/`ushort`/`uint`/`ulong`/`uintptr`/`nuint`) — so `flags &= ~b` is CS0266. The complemented value is therefore cast back to the LHS type, inside `unchecked` because for a *constant* operand `~b` folds to a negative `int` constant whose checked narrowing would overflow (CS0221):

```go
h.flags &^= hashWriting   // h.flags is uint8
```
```csharp
h.val.flags &= unchecked((uint8)~hashWriting);
```

An LHS type that `int` widens to implicitly (`int`/`int32`/`int64`) needs no cast and stays `a &= ~b`. (Guarded by the `AndNotAssignNarrow` behavioral test, which exercises both an ident LHS and a struct-field LHS — they route through different assignment-emission paths.)

## The "nil" Value
In Go, `nil` is the equivalent of C# `null`. Where possible, converted code uses the golib [`NilType`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/NilType.cs) with a default instance called `nil` (defined in [`go.builtin`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/builtin.cs)). `NilType` provides comparison operators so `x == nil` / `x != nil` work across the runtime types (slices, maps, channels, pointers, interfaces), each of which defines what "nil" means for it (e.g. a `map<K,V>` whose backing dictionary is null is the nil map: reads return the zero value, `len` is 0, ranging yields nothing, and a write panics — matching Go).

The same null-safe-zero-value principle applies to value types whose backing store is a reference. A zero-value `string` converts to `@string s = default!`, which runs no constructor, so the backing `byte[]` is null. Rather than NRE on the first read, `@string` treats a null backing as Go's empty string `""` for every read — length 0, no bytes to index/range, `== ""` is true, prints empty, and concatenation yields the other operand (`var s string; s += "x"` → `"x"`). Constructors still allocate, so only the `default(@string)` zero value relies on this. (Guarded by the `StringZeroValueConcat` behavioral test.)

## Empty Interface
In Go, every type satisfies the method-less interface `interface{}`, now spelled `any`. This operates fundamentally like .NET's `System.Object`, so the converter maps the Go empty interface to `any` (a global alias for `object`). For example, a Go `func(i interface{})` becomes `void f(any i)`, and a `map[any]string` becomes `map<any, @string>`.

## Inline Assignment Order of Operations
All right-hand operands in assignment expressions in Go are evaluated before assignment to the left-hand operands. C# can operate equivalently using tuple deconstruction (_thanks to Eugene Bekker for the [suggestion](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/issues/6)_). For the following Go code:

```go
x, y = y, x+y
```
the equivalent C# code operates as follows:
```csharp
(x, y) = (y, x + y);
```

Go's **partial redeclaration** — `a, b := f()` where `a` already exists in the same scope — reuses `a` (assigns it) and declares only the new names. A blanket `var (a, b)` would re-declare the reused variable, so the converter emits `var` per *newly-declared* element only:

```go
frac, e := normalize(frac)   // frac is the existing parameter; e is new
```
```csharp
(frac, var e) = normalize(frac);
```

The same per-element mechanism handles a destructured element whose **address is taken** (`list, delta := netpoll(0); injectglist(&list)`). Such a local must be heap-boxed so its `Ꮡlist` companion exists, but the combined `var (list, delta) = …` deconstruction cannot declare it as a `ref var … = ref heap(…)`. The converter emits the escaping element's heap declaration first, then a mixed deconstruction-assignment in which the escaping element is the pre-declared box ref-local and the rest declare with `var`:

```go
list, delta := netpoll(0)
injectglist(&list)
```
```csharp
ref var list = ref heap<gList>(out var Ꮡlist);
(list, var delta) = netpoll(0);     // list is the box ref-local; delta is newly declared
injectglist(Ꮡlist);                 // Ꮡlist now exists
```

Without this, `&list` emits `Ꮡlist` with no box (CS0103), and the `Ꮡ(value)` copy fallback would silently lose writes made through the pointer. (Guarded by the `TupleDestructureEscapingLocal` behavioral test — a mutate-through-pointer proves the real local is updated; runtime exercises it in the `netpoll` poll loops.)

A subtler case: a newly-declared tuple element can be flagged *escaping* by analysis yet need **no** heap box — typically an already-pointer local that is merely returned (`pp, now := pidleget(now)`, where `pp` is a `*p` that the function returns). The heap-decl path above only owns elements that produce an actual `ref var … = ref heap(…)`; an escaping element with no such declaration must still be counted as newly-declared so it receives its `var`, or the deconstruction emits `(pp, now) = …` with `pp` declared nowhere (CS0103). Both the mixed (`(var pp, now) = …`, reusing the value parameter `now`) and the all-shadowing (`var (ppΔ1, gpΔ1) = …`) forms are handled. (Guarded by the `TupleMixedDeclareReassign` behavioral test; runtime hits it in `pidlegetSpinning` and `findRunnable`.)

## Short Variable Redeclaration (Shadowing)

When using Go's short variable declaration syntax, e.g., `x := 2`, a variable can be redeclared in a lesser (nested) scope. The inner declaration "shadows" the outer one: the inner instance is manipulated while the outer value is preserved, and once the inner scope ends the outer variable still holds its original value.

C# forbids a local (or a lambda parameter) from shadowing an enclosing local of the same name (CS0136). So rather than the older save/restore approach, the converter **renames** the shadowing inner variable with a `Δ` disambiguation suffix (`x` → `xΔ1`, `xΔ2`, …) and rewrites all references within that scope to the renamed identifier. The outer variable is untouched, so its value is naturally preserved. For example:

```go
func sumWithLenLocal(buf []int) int {
    total := 0
    len := len(buf)       // a local named like the built-in, shadowing it
    for i := 0; i < len; i++ {
        total += i
    }
    return total + len
}
```

converts to:

```csharp
internal static nint sumWithLenLocal(slice<nint> buf) {
    nint total = 0;
    nint lenΔ1 = len(buf);          // renamed; the built-in call stays `len(...)`
    for (nint i = 0; i < lenΔ1; i++) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total + lenΔ1;
}
```

The same `Δ` mechanism handles a local shadowing a called built-in (as above), a nested-block variable shadowing a function-level one, an IIFE/closure parameter colliding with an outer local, and a type-switch guard (`switch x := x.(type)`) whose variable shadows an enclosing one — the guard is renamed within the switch (`case T xΔ1:`) while references after the switch still resolve to the enclosing variable, matching Go's scoping.

Renaming depends on correctly identifying which declarations are *function-level* — the set a nested variable of the same name must avoid (C# forbids the nested one even when the function-level one is declared *later*). A `for init; …` loop's `:=` variable, and a range `:=` key/value, are scoped to their own statement, **not** the function body, so they are deliberately excluded from that set. Recording a for-loop variable as function-level (it is encountered first, in source order) would mask the real function-level variable of the same name declared afterward — `for b := …{} for b := …{} … b := newBucket(…)` — leaving *all three* emitted as `b` and colliding (CS0136). With the for-loop variables correctly treated as inner scopes, they are renamed `bΔ1`/`bΔ2` while the function-level `b` keeps its name. (Guarded by the `ForVarMasksFuncLevel` behavioral test; runtime hit this in `stkbucket`.)

The same forward-collision rule applies at **every block level, not just the function body**. C# CS0136 fires whenever a name is declared in two scopes where one encloses the other, *regardless of declaration order* — so a nested variable must be renamed if the same name is declared anywhere in an enclosing block, whether that declaration appears before or after it in source. The scope-stack walk only records declarations already seen (backward), and the function-level forward set covers only the function body; a variable declared **later in an intermediate enclosing block** would otherwise be missed. To close that gap, each block scope (function body, `if`/`for`/`range`/`switch`/`select` bodies, bare blocks, and `case`/comm-clause bodies) is pre-scanned for its directly-declared names (`:=` and `var`, excluding a control statement's own init `:=`, which is scoped to that statement) when the scope is pushed, so forward declarations are visible to the shadow check. For example, the runtime's `runGCProg` has two `for off := …` loops followed by `off := n - nbits` *in the same enclosing `for {}` body* — the block-level `off` encloses both loops, so the loop variables are renamed `offΔ1`/`offΔ2` while the block-level `off` keeps its name. (Guarded by the `ForVarMasksBlockLevel` behavioral test — distinct from `ForVarMasksFuncLevel`, where the later same-named variable is function-level; this cleared 5 runtime CS0136 in `runGCProg`/`mprof`/`runtime1`/`time`.)

The reverse collision — a package **method named like a built-in** — needs the opposite treatment. In Go a method `func (b *pageBits) clear()` and the universe `clear` built-in coexist: the method is only ever reached as `b.clear()`, while a free `clear(s)` is always the built-in. But the method is emitted as a `clear(this ref pageBits)` extension on the package's static class, and C# member lookup binds that same-class member for an *unqualified* free `clear(s)` call — shadowing the using-static `go.builtin.clear` and failing (`CS1620`/`CS1503`). So a built-in call whose name the package also declares as a method/function is emitted **qualified** — `builtin.clear(s)` — which resolves to the golib built-in regardless of the same-class shadow; the method call stays `b.clear()`. (This also required golib to gain the Go 1.21 `clear` built-in itself, in slice/span/map forms. Guarded by the `ClearBuiltinShadow` behavioral test; runtime hit this on `pageBits.clear`/`sweepClass.clear`, ~11 errors.)

For a **function-literal parameter** that shadows an enclosing local, the rename must reach the parameter *declaration* itself, not just the body: `run(func(n int){ … n … })` where an outer `n` is in scope emits `run((nint nΔ1) => { … nΔ1 … })`. The body's uses already resolve to `nΔ1`; if the signature still declared the bare `n` (the raw name), the body's `nΔ1` would be undeclared (CS0103). The parameter name in the emitted lambda signature therefore comes from the same shadow-aware identifier mapping as the body (the raw name when nothing is shadowed, so plain function types and non-shadowing parameters are unchanged). (Guarded by the `ClosureParamShadow` behavioral test; the runtime hit this pervasively on `mcall`/`systemstack(func(gp *g){…})` where the closure's `gp` shadows an outer `gp`, ~40 CS0103.)

Conversely, a **local that shadows a *pointer parameter*** must not inherit the parameter's special emission. A deref-aliased pointer parameter is `ж<T> Ꮡp` with `ref var p = ref Ꮡp.val`, so passing it whole to a `*T`-expecting function emits its box `Ꮡp`. But a *local* `t` shadowing a `t *T` parameter (`func mapKeyError2(t *_type, …){ … var t *_type; … }`) is a plain pointer local — passing it should stay `use(tΔ2)`, not `use(ᏑtΔ2)` (the spurious `&` references an undefined `ᏑtΔ2` box → CS0103). The bug was that the "is this a parameter?" check matched by *name*, so the shadowing local was misclassified; it now verifies the resolved object is genuinely one of the function's parameter objects, not just a name match. (Guarded by the `ShadowedPointerParam` behavioral test; runtime hit this on `mapKeyError2`/`interhash`'s inner `var t *_type`, ~11 CS0103.)

### Type-vs-Method Name Collisions

Go keeps types and methods in separate namespaces, so a package may legally declare both a type `foo` and a method `foo` on some receiver. In C# both land in the same package class — the nested type and the `[GoRecv]` extension method — where a type and a method cannot share a name (CS0102). The converter resolves this by `Δ`-prefixing the **type** (`Δfoo`) while the method keeps its core-sanitized name (`foo`), so they no longer collide.

This needs an extra step when the colliding name is also a **golib reserved word** (`slice`, `array`, `channel`, `map`, …). Such a name is `Δ`-prefixed *anyway* — to avoid the golib runtime type (`slice<T>` etc.) — so the method too becomes `Δslice`, and the plain `Δ` no longer separates type from method. In that case the converter appends the type marker `ᴛ` to the **type** only, giving it a name distinct from the method:

```csharp
[GoType] partial struct Δsliceᴛ { … }                          // Go `type slice struct{…}`
[GoRecv] internal static Δsliceᴛ Δslice(this ref builder b, …) // Go `func (*builder) slice(…)`
```

Only the type side is renamed; the method (and every call site and go2cs-gen-generated pointer-receiver overload) stays `Δslice`. This is deliberate: the go2cs-gen generators compute method names independently, so renaming the *method* would desync them — renaming the *type* keeps the converter and generators in agreement (the generators read the type name from the emitted C# syntax/attributes). This mirrors the Go runtime's `type slice struct{…}` (the GC slice header) versus `func (*userArena) slice(…)`.

A **struct field** named like a colliding package-level identifier is *not* renamed: a field is struct-scoped (`g.trace` does not collide with a package type/method `trace` in C#), so the field declaration keeps its core-sanitized name (`trace`). The box-field accessor static the `TypeGenerator` emits for it is therefore `g.Ꮡtrace` (the `Ꮡ`-prefixed declared member name). The converter's `&g.field` address form (`Ꮡg.of(g.Ꮡtrace)`) must use that **declared** field name — it derives the accessor member from `getCoreSanitizedIdentifier` plus the type-colliding rename, *not* from the general identifier path that applies the package-level collision `Δ`-rename. Using the latter would emit `g.ᏑΔtrace`, which has no matching generated static (CS0117). Reserved-word fields keep their `Δ` (the field really is declared `Δarray` for a field named `array`), so the accessor is `Ꮡ`+the declared name in every case. (Guarded by the `CollisionFieldBoxAccessor` behavioral test; runtime hit this on `g`/`m`/`p`'s `trace`/`stack`/`p` fields, ~20 CS0117.)

The *type* half of the same accessor (`receiver.of(Type.Ꮡfield)`) needs care too. Go code routinely names a local after its own type — `m := getg().m`, where `m` is a `*m` — so taking the address of one of its fields (`&m.park`) emits `m.of(m.Ꮡpark)`, in which the bare type reference `m` binds to the **variable** `m` (a `ж<m>`, which has no `Ꮡpark`) instead of the type (CS1061). Because a converted struct is nested in its package's static class, the converter qualifies the type with that class — `m.of(runtime_package.m.Ꮡpark)` — which a same-named local cannot shadow. A bare `m` (binds the variable) and a `go.m` (the struct is not a direct member of the `go` namespace) both fail; the package-class qualifier is the correct form. This is applied **only on a collision** (the `.of()` receiver variable's name equals the type's simple name), so every other box accessor keeps its un-namespaced, Go-like form — no golden churn. (Guarded by the `VarNamedAsType` behavioral test; runtime hit this on `m`/`Δp` locals taking field addresses, ~9 CS1061.)

A related case is the **box name of a shadow-renamed receiver/parameter**. A deref-aliased pointer (a receiver or a `*T` parameter) is emitted as `ref var <name> = ref Ꮡ<raw>.val` — the `Ꮡ` companion always keeps the **raw** Go name, even when the value alias is shadow-renamed for a collision (`func (p *cpuProfile) add()` where `p` collides with the type `p` → `ref var Δp = ref Ꮡp.val`). When a pointer-receiver (capture-mode) method is then called on that receiver/parameter, the call routes through the box, and that box reference must use the raw name `Ꮡp` — the value alias `Δp` would yield `ᏑΔp`, which is not in scope (CS0103). The converter builds the box from the raw identifier name (not the shadow-renamed value form), but only when they differ — so non-renamed receivers are unaffected (no churn).

The same raw-box-name rule applies when such a shadow-renamed pointer is **captured by a closure** (where the value alias is referenced through its box, since the `ref`-local can't be captured — see the *box-ref* section below). A value use inside the closure becomes `Ꮡp.val.n` and a field-address use `Ꮡp.of(T.Ꮡn)` — both rooted at the raw box name `Ꮡp`, never the renamed `ᏑΔp`. The field-address form (`&p.field`) routes through the box-ref address path rather than the generic pointer-variable path: that generic path would prepend `Ꮡ` onto the closure's box-deref read (`Ꮡp.val`), yielding a double-boxed `ᏑᏑp.val` (CS0103). Because the captured pointer's box `Ꮡp` *is* the `ж<T>`, the field address is simply `Ꮡp.of(T.Ꮡfield)` — the same form as a captured value struct. (Guarded by the `RenamedReceiverBox` behavioral test, which exercises a shadow-renamed receiver calling a capture-mode method, plus a shadow-renamed pointer parameter both read through and field-addressed inside a closure; runtime hit this on `p`/`Δp` receivers calling methods like `p.addExtra()` and on closures capturing such pointers, ~12+ CS0103.)

The same rule applies to an **escaping local** whose address is taken — `var p _panic; … preprintpanics(&p)` in runtime's `gopanic`, where `p` collides with the type `p`. The heap allocation is `ref var Δp = ref heap(new _panic(), out var Ꮡp)`, so the box is `Ꮡp` (raw) and `&p` must emit `Ꮡp`, not `ᏑΔp`. **Crucially, the box-name rule is keyed to the rename *kind*, because the two kinds name their boxes differently:** a type-**collision** rename prepends the marker (`p` → `Δp`) but keeps the raw box (`Ꮡp`), whereas a nested-scope **shadow** rename appends the marker plus a counter (`i` → `iΔ1`, `iΔ2`) and keeps the *shadow* box (`ref var iΔ1 = ref heap<nint>(out var ᏑiΔ1)`, so `&i` correctly emits `ᏑiΔ1`). The converter therefore rewrites to the raw name *only* when the alias is exactly `Δ`+rawname (the collision form); a shadow-renamed or non-renamed var keeps its existing box name. (Guarded by the `CollisionRenamedLocalBox` behavioral test, with `ForVariants`/`NestedVarShadow` covering the shadow-rename form left unchanged.)

## Return Tuples
Many Go functions return either a single value or a "value, ok"/"value, error" tuple, where only the declared return arity selects the behavior. You cannot differentiate C# overloads by return type alone, so the runtime types expose a second overload distinguished by an extra discard argument. For map access, the "comma-ok" read routes through a two-value indexer using the discard sentinel `ꟷ`:

```csharp
var v1 = m["Answer"];            // single value: zero value if the key is absent
var (v2, ok) = m["Answer", ꟷ];   // comma-ok: (value, present?)
```

These two forms can behave differently — case in point, [type assertions](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions): the single-value form panics on failure, while the comma-ok form returns safely with a boolean success result. Type assertions convert similarly, through a generated `_<T>()` accessor:

```csharp
var t = i._<MyType>();              // panics on failure
var (t, ok) = i._<MyType>(ᐧ);       // comma-ok, safe
```

The types that support these tuple-returns are defined in the [`golib`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/tree/master/src/core/golib) library; ordinary user-code tuple returns convert as normal C# tuples without special handling.

## Slices and Arrays
Go slices and arrays are converted to the golib [`slice<T>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/slice.cs) and [`array<T>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/array.cs) structures. A `make`-style allocation uses a constructor; a composite literal builds a C# array and projects it with the `.slice()` / `.array()` extension:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}   // array literal
    nums := []int{10, 20, 30}              // slice literal
    buf := make([]byte, 4)                 // make
    fmt.Println(primes[0], nums[2], len(buf))
}
```

converts to:

```csharp
internal static void Main() {
    var primes = new nint[]{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}.array();
    var nums = new nint[]{10, 20, 30}.slice();
    var buf = new slice<byte>(4);
    fmt.Println(primes[0], nums[2], len(buf));
}
```

A **named** slice/array type (`type d [3]rune`, `type s []int`) lowers to a struct wrapping `array<T>`/`slice<T>`; its composite literal cannot use C# collection-initializer braces (the lowered struct has no `Add`), so it is constructed through the underlying-collection constructor: `d{0, 32, 0}` → `new d(new rune[]{0, 32, 0}.array())`.

**Slicing a pointer-to-array.** Go lets a `*[N]T` be sliced directly — `p[lo:hi:max]`, `p[:]` — auto-dereferencing the array. The C# box `ж<array<T>>` has no slice/range members (its underlying `array<T>` does), so the converter dereferences first: `p[1:3:4]` → `(~p).slice(1, 3, 4)`, `p[:]` → `(~p)[..]`, `p[2:]` → `(~p)[2..]`. Without the deref the call binds to the box and fails (CS1929). The resulting slice shares the array's backing storage, matching Go. (The `(*[N]T)(ptr)[:n]` pointer-*cast* form is different — it goes through the `new Span<T>(ptr, n)` path above and is unaffected.) (Guarded by the `PointerArraySlice` behavioral test; runtime hits this in `select.go`'s `cas1[:ncases:ncases]` and `mprof.go`'s `stk[:n:n]`, and clearing it unblocked a cascade of dependent `Span`-deconstruction and cast-then-index errors.)

An **untyped (type-inferred) composite literal** — the inner `{…}` of a `[][]rank{ key: {…} }`, which has no explicit type node — is emitted as a target-typed `new(…)` when its inferred type is a struct (the struct constructor takes the field values). When the inferred type is a **slice or array**, that form is wrong (`slice<rank>`/`array<rank>` have no element-list constructor → CS1729); the converter emits the element-array projection instead — `{rA, rB}` (inferred `[]rank`) → `new rank[]{rA, rB}.slice()`, and an inferred `[2]int` → `new nint[]{…}.array()`. When the inferred type is a **pointer-to-struct** — the `[]*T{ {…} }` shorthand for `&T{…}` — it is emitted as the boxed struct constructor `Ꮡ(new T(field: val, …))` (a bare `new(…)` would target the box `ж<T>`, whose constructor lacks the struct's fields → CS1739). (Guarded by `UntypedNestedSliceComposite`; runtime/lockrank.go's `lockPartialOrder` is a `[][]lockRank`, and runtime1.go's `dbgvars` is a `[]*dbgVar`, of these.)

An **indexed (keyed) slice/array literal** — `[]string{lockRankSysmon: "sysmon", …}` — is emitted as a golib `runtime.SparseArray<T>` collection initializer (`[index] = value`). Its indexer takes a Go `int`. When an index key's Go type is a **defined integer type** whose underlying type does not implicitly widen to C# `int` (i.e. `int`/`int64`/`uint`/`uint32`/`uint64`/`uintptr`, as opposed to `int8`/`uint8`/`int16`/`uint16`/`int32`), the key is cast to `int` so it satisfies the indexer (CS1503 otherwise): `[lockRankSysmon]` (a `type lockRank int`) → `[(int)lockRankSysmon]`. A key that already widens (e.g. a `uint8`-backed `Kind`) is left uncast.

A **generic** named array type carries its type parameters (and their constraints) onto the forward declaration, and its element type is emitted fully qualified in the `[GoType]` attribute so the generated array-backed partial — which lives in a file without this file's package-relative `using` aliases — can resolve it:

```go
type table[T any] [3]atomic.Pointer[T]
```
```csharp
[GoType("[3]sync.atomic_package.Pointer<T>")] partial struct table<T>
    where T : new();
```

An **anonymous array/slice field whose element type lives in a multi-segment-path package** — `cpuLogWrite [2]atomic.Pointer[profBuf]`, `children [4]atomic.UnsafePointer` (atomic = `internal/runtime/atomic`) — keeps its `array<…>` wrapper. The field's type name is built structurally from the `[N]`/`[]` marker plus the recursively resolved element, *not* from the type's package-qualified string: that string (`[2]internal/runtime/atomic.Pointer[…]`) goes through a cross-package last-segment strip that would also remove the leading `[2]`, collapsing the field to the bare element type (`atomic.Pointer<…> = new(2)`) whose array `new(2)` initializer then mis-binds the element constructor (CS1503). With the structural rendering the field stays `array<atomic.Pointer<profBuf>> = new(2)`. An array of a current-package or basic-typed element was unaffected (its string has no foreign path to strip). (Guarded by the `ArrayOfCrossPackageType` behavioral test — `[3]atomic.Int32` / `[2]atomic.Uint64` fields, a Compile + target guard; runtime's `trace`/`traceMap` structs hold these.)

A **built-in used as a generic type argument** is rendered in its golib form, the same as anywhere else — in particular Go `string` becomes golib `@string`, never C# `string` (`System.String`). This matters because the converter adds a `new()` constraint to every generic type parameter: `@string` is a struct with a public parameterless constructor and satisfies it, whereas `System.String` would violate it (CS0310), and assigning a string literal — emitted as a `u8` `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` — into such a field would fail (CS0029). So:

```go
type Pair[A any, B any] struct { a A; b B }
var p Pair[int, string]
p.b = "hi"
```
```csharp
Pair<nint, @string> p = default!;
p.b = "hi"u8;
```

This applies uniformly to every type-argument position — first, second-or-later, and nested (`Pair[int, Box[string]]` → `Pair<nint, Box<@string>>`). (The behavioral test `GenericStringTypeArg` guards these cases; `NestedGenericTypes` covers the nesting depth without string args.)

### Converting a string to `[]byte` / `[]rune`
A Go `[]byte(s)` / `[]rune(s)` element-decoding conversion is emitted as the golib element-slice form `slice<byte>(…)` / `slice<rune>(…)`, which relies on the `@string`→`slice<byte>`/`slice<rune>` conversion. When the source is a string **variable** it is already golib `@string`, so the conversion applies directly. When the source is a bare string **literal**, that literal would otherwise render as a `System.String` (no such conversion exists — CS1503/CS1929), so the converter casts it to `@string` first:

```go
bs := []byte("hello")
rs := []rune("héllo")
```
```csharp
var bs = slice<byte>((@string)"hello");
var rs = slice<rune>((@string)"héllo");
```

The `@string` cast fires only on a string-literal argument; a string-variable conversion (`[]byte(s)`) needs no cast. (Guarded by the behavioral test `StringLiteralSliceConversion`.)

### Converting a string literal to a named string type
A Go conversion of a string **literal** to a named type whose underlying type is `string` — `errorString("…")` where `type errorString string` — needs the same `@string` intermediate. The literal renders as a `u8` `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`, which has no conversion to the named type, so a bare `(errorString)"…"u8` is CS0030. The converter routes it through `@string` (which converts implicitly from the `u8` span and to which the named type converts):

```go
return errorString("kaboom")
```
```csharp
return ((errorString)(@string)"kaboom"u8);
```

This is the form the runtime uses for every `panic(errorString("…"))` / `plainError("…")`. (Guarded by the behavioral test `NamedStringConversion`.)

## Maps and Channels
Go maps and channels convert to the golib [`map<K,V>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/map.cs) and [`channel<T>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/channel.cs) structures. `make` becomes a constructor; channel send/receive use the runtime operators:

```go
m := make(map[string]int)
c := make(chan int, 3)
```
```csharp
var m = new map<@string, nint>();
var c = new channel<nint>(3);
```

Map reads honor Go's nil-map and comma-ok semantics (see [The "nil" Value](#the-nil-value) and [Return Tuples](#return-tuples)).

## Generic Constraints
A Go generic constraint becomes a C# `where` clause. Most type-set constraints lift to the matching golib/.NET interface — a `[]T` element constraint to `ISlice<T>`, `map[K]V` to `IMap<K,V>`, `chan T` to `IChannel<T>` — plus, for operator-bearing type sets, the `System.Numerics` operator interfaces (`IAdditionOperators`, `IComparisonOperators`, …) so the body's `+`/`<`/`==` on the type parameter compile. The Go built-in `comparable` maps to golib's CRTP `comparable<T>`.

### The `string | []byte` union
C# generic constraints are conjunctive ("and"), so they cannot express Go's `string | []byte` union directly. The two members share no operators (the union is neither comparable nor additive), so a conforming body may only use the read operations common to both — indexing, `len`, and sub-slicing. These are captured by the golib read-only byte-sequence interface [`IByteSeq<T>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/IByteSeq.cs), which both `@string` (as `IByteSeq<byte>`) and `slice<T>` implement; the converter emits it for the union and suppresses the (spurious) lifted operator constraints:
```go
func HashStr[T string | []byte](sep T) uint32 { /* uses sep[i], len(sep) */ }
```
```csharp
public static uint32 HashStr<T>(T sep)
    where T : /* string | []byte */ IByteSeq<byte>, new()
{ /* … */ }
```
A sub-slice of a constrained value is itself an `IByteSeq<byte>`, and Go's `string(s[lo:hi])` becomes `new @string(s[lo..hi])` via an `@string(IByteSeq<byte>)` constructor. `len` resolves through a generic `len<T>(IByteSeq<T>)` overload that is dispreferred for concrete `slice<byte>`/`@string` arguments, so existing call sites keep their specific overloads (no ambiguity). The behavioral test `StringByteUnionConstraint` exercises both the `string` and `[]byte` instantiations.

## Type Aliasing
Go supports two kinds of [type aliasing](https://go101.org/article/type-system-overview.html#type-definition): a "type definition" and a "type alias declaration".

### Type Definitions
For a Go "type definition" the new type is a distinct type that shares an [underlying type](https://go101.org/article/type-system-overview.html#underlying-type) with its base. Because converted types are structs (no inheritance), the converter relies on the source generators (see [Source Generators](#source-generators)) to emit the bridging needed for these to be used interchangeably while remaining distinct: implicit conversion operators down to the underlying type (via `ImplicitConvGenerator` / `TypeGenerator`), and, where the base is a built-in like `slice`, the relevant interface (`ISlice<T>`, etc.) implementation. A named type also supports the extension methods (receiver functions) of its underlying types, which the generators surface as proxy/overload methods.

When a pointer conversion `(*Target)(srcPtr)` bridges two structurally-identical structs, the converter records an **indirect** (boxing) implicit conversion `Source → ж<Target>` and `ImplicitConvGenerator` emits `implicit operator ж<Target>(Source src) => Ꮡ(new Target(<members>))`. For a **self-boxing** conversion — `Source` and `Target` are the *same* struct (`mspan → ж<mspan>`), which arises from a self-referential struct's recursive sub-struct conversions — that member-by-member reconstruction is both unnecessary and wrong: a pointer field whose target ctor parameter is itself a `ж<…>` was deref'd (`src.f?.val ?? default!`), and a value cannot bind a pointer parameter (CS1503). The generator detects self-boxing (the boxed element type equals the source) and emits `Ꮡ(src)` instead — boxing a copy of the whole struct directly, identical in effect for a pointer-free struct and correct for one with pointer fields. (Validated by the green baseline build, which regenerates every `.g.cs`, plus the `TypeConversion` behavioral test for the non-self-boxing form; runtime exercised self-boxing for `mspan`, `g`, `stackScanState`, `hmap`, etc.)

### Type Alias Declarations
For a Go "type alias declaration" the alias matches C# aliasing implemented with the `using` keyword. Since the alias may be exported and referenced across files, the converter emits a **global** `using` (C# 10's [Global Using Directive](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/csharp-10.0/GlobalUsingDirective.md)) into the package's generated aliases. For example:

```go
type P = *bool
type M = map[int]int
type table = map[string]int
```
```csharp
global using P = go.ж<bool>;
global using M = go.map<nint, nint>;
global using table = go.map<@string, nint>;
```

## Delegates to Value Receiver Instances

In Go a function is a value; a value-receiver method can be assigned to a variable, and the variable captures **its own copy** of the receiver value at the moment of assignment. This surprises many non-Go programmers:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type data struct {
    name string
}

func (d data) printName() {
    fmt.Println("Name =", d.name)
}

func main() {
    d := data{name: "James"}
    f1 := d.printName
    f1()
    d.name = "Gretchen"
    f1()
}
```
This prints `Name = James` twice ([run it](https://play.golang.org/p/d-A5re1dfs8)) — `f1` bound a copy of `d`, so the later mutation is not observed. To preserve this semantic, the converter copies the receiver value into the delegate's capture rather than capturing the variable by reference, so the delegate executes against the snapshot taken at assignment time.

## Defer / Panic / Recover
Handling Go `defer` / `panic` / `recover` requires that the converted function run inside a [Go function execution context](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/GoFunc.cs). The context provides the [`defer`](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements) call stack and the [`recover`](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#recover) handling; `panic` is the global [`panic`](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#panic) built-in (a `using static go.builtin`). The body is emitted as a lambda taking two parameters, `defer` and `recover`:

```go
func f() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered in f", r)
        }
    }()
    fmt.Println("Calling g.")
    g(0)
}

func g(i int) {
    if i > 3 {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("%v", i))
    }
    defer fmt.Println("Defer in g", i)
    g(i + 1)
}
```

converts to:

```csharp
internal static void f() => func((defer, recover) => {
    defer(() => {
        {
            var r = recover();
            if (r != nil) {
                fmt.Println("Recovered in f", r);
            }
        }
    });
    fmt.Println("Calling g.");
    g(0);
});

internal static void g(nint i) => func((defer, recover) => {
    if (i > 3) {
        throw panic(fmt.Sprintf("%v"u8, i));
    }
    defer(() => fmt.Println("Defer in g", i));
    g(i + 1);
});
```

A function that neither directly nor indirectly (through a deferred lambda) uses `defer`/`panic`/`recover` skips the wrapper entirely — the converter scopes the wrapper per function, so e.g. a `main` that just calls `f()` is emitted as a plain method body. A value-returning function returns from inside the wrapper (`=> func((defer, recover) => { …; return x; })`). Two refinements worth noting:

* **Named results + defer.** When a function has named return values *and* uses defer/recover, the named results are declared *outside* the wrapper (closure-captured), the wrapper runs as a `void` action, and the function returns the named results afterward — so the deferred "recover sets the result" idiom is observed.
* **IIFEs.** An immediately-invoked function literal that itself uses defer/recover gets its own wrapper, rendered as a delegate-cast invocation (e.g. `((Func<int>)(() => func((defer, recover) => { … })))()`), so its `recover` scopes to the IIFE and not the enclosing function.

## Expression Switch Statements
Go expression-based `switch` statements are flexible: cases do not fall through automatically (no `break` needed), and the `fallthrough` keyword runs the next case body bypassing its expression. Based on the [Manual Tour of Go Conversions](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/tree/master/src/Examples/Manual%20Tour%20of%20Go%20Conversions), converting to `if / else if / else` is the best choice for most cases. When every case label is a C# **compile-time constant** and there is no `fallthrough`, a traditional C# `switch` works. "Constant" here means a C# `const` — a literal, a computed literal expression (`a + b`), or a *typed* basic-type const — not merely a Go constant. A case label that references a plain variable, a struct field (`case frame.fp`), an *untyped* / named-type / cross-package const emitted as `static readonly` (`case goarch.PtrSize`), or an address-of expression (`case &g`) is **not** a C# constant, so a C# `switch` case label there is invalid (CS9135 / CS0150). Such switches fall back to the `if / else if` form comparing the tag with `==` (a temp captures the tag: `var exprᴛ1 = tag; if (exprᴛ1 == frame.fp) …`). The same constant-vs-runtime-value test also chooses `is` (constant pattern) vs `==` for a single-value case within the if-else form. For cases that use `fallthrough`, the cases are expanded to standalone `if` statements with a local fall-through flag and `goto` to handle break-style exits — the most complex (and least pretty) scenario. A comparison case may use a C# relational/constant pattern (`case {} when x is < 0`) only when the compared-to operand is a C# compile-time constant; for a variable (`case x == y`) or a `static readonly` const (untyped/cross-package), it falls back to a `when` guard (`case {} when x == y`) — a relational pattern there is invalid (CS9135).

## Type Switch Statements
For a Go type-switch, C#'s type-pattern `switch` works well. The runtime exposes the dynamic type via `.type()`, and the empty interface is `any`:

```go
func do(i interface{}) {
    switch v := i.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Printf("Twice %v is %v\n", v, v*2)
    case string:
        fmt.Printf("%q is %v bytes long\n", v, len(v))
    default:
        fmt.Printf("I don't know about type %T!\n", v)
    }
}
```

converts to:

```csharp
internal static void @do(any i) {
    switch (i.type()) {
    case nint v: {
        fmt.Printf("Twice %v is %v\n"u8, v, v * 2);
        break;
    }
    case @string v: {
        fmt.Printf("%q is %v bytes long\n"u8, v, len(v));
        break;
    }
    default: {
        var v = i.type();
        fmt.Printf("I don't know about type %T!\n"u8, v);
        break;
    }}
}
```

## Struct Types
Go structs are converted to C# `struct` types and used on the stack to optimize memory use and reduce GC pressure; when an instance must escape the stack it is wrapped in a heap box, [`ж<T>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/%D0%B6.cs) (see [Pointers](#pointers)). Rather than spell out the whole struct body, the converter emits a partial struct carrying a `[GoType]` attribute, and the `TypeGenerator` source generator synthesizes the members (equality, `ISupportMake`, embedding promotion, etc.):

```csharp
[GoType] partial struct Person {
    public @string Name;
    public nint Age;
}
```

The generator also chooses the access modifier from the Go name (exported → `public`, unexported → `internal`), except where the converter emits an explicit modifier — for instance, an unexported type used as the type of an *exported* field is published as `public` to satisfy C# accessibility (the converter emits `public partial struct …` and the generator honors that explicit modifier).

A combined Go field declaration — `x, y int` — emits a single combined C# line (`internal nint x, y;`) so the output mirrors the Go source's line grouping. The combined form is only used when every name in the group shares the same emitted type and access modifier and none needs per-name special handling; otherwise the converter falls back to one line per name. The fallback applies when any of these hold: a blank field `_` (renamed per occurrence — `_`, `__`, …), a name equal to the enclosing struct type (renamed with the `Δ` collision marker), a per-field array initializer (` = new(N)`), or a mix of exported and unexported names in the same group (`X, y int` → `public nint X;` / `internal nint y;`). Field comments and tags attach to the whole Go field, so they never diverge within a group.

C# does not allow inline or intra-function type definitions, so these are "lifted" out of the function. A **named** local type is lifted with its enclosing function's name as a prefix to avoid collisions — a `type x struct{…}` declared in `main` becomes `main_x`. An **anonymous** struct (or an anonymous struct used as a field/value) is lifted to a synthesized name with a `ᴛ`*N* suffix and marked dynamic, e.g. `[GoType("dyn")] partial struct settingsᴛ1`. Struct "definitions" that match structurally remain usable interchangeably (the generator and implicit conversions handle this).

## Struct Type Embedding
Go structs use "[type embedding](https://go101.org/article/type-embedding.html)" instead of inheritance. Since converted structs are C# `struct`s (no inheritance), the `TypeGenerator` manages the equivalent: it adds a field for the embedded type and promotes the embedded type's fields and methods (selection shorthand). Both field and method promotion are **transitive through every embedding level**: when `top` embeds `mid` which embeds `inner`, `top` gets an accessor for `inner`'s field `n` (`top.n => ref mid.n`) and a forwarding receiver for `inner`'s method `describe` (`top.describe() => target.mid.describe()`), each resolving through `mid`'s own one-level promotion. The generator collects an embedded struct's members and methods recursively (following each field whose name equals its type's simple name — Go's embedding marker), with the closest declaration of a name winning, matching Go's promotion rules. **Pointer embeds promote too.** Go also embeds by pointer (`*traceBuf`), whose C# field type is `ж<traceBuf>`; its methods and fields are promoted exactly like a value embed (the field's ref-property is dereferenced — `target.traceBuf.val.method()` — which binds the pointer-receiver method via the `[GoRecv]` `ж<T>` overload). The embedding-marker comparison dereferences the field type first, because a pointer field's simple name carries a `.val` suffix (`traceBuf.val`) that would never match the bare embed field name. This matters most *transitively*: `traceExpWriter` embeds `traceWriter` (value) which embeds `*traceBuf` (pointer), and `traceBuf`'s `varint`/`byte` must promote all the way up — without the deref-aware marker the nested pointer embed is skipped and the upper struct silently loses the method (CS1929). (Guarded by the `NestedEmbeddingPromotion` behavioral test for value embeds and the `PointerEmbeddingPromotion` test for one-level and two-level-transitive pointer embeds; runtime relies on the field case for `stackWorkBuf` → `stackWorkBufHdr` → `workbufhdr.nobj` and the pointer case for the trace writers. Caveat: a *zero-value* struct does not initialize the embedded type's captured box, so promoted access on a `default`-constructed value NREs — construct via a composite literal.) Because the promotion is performed at conversion time by the generator, methods added later in hand-written C# are not automatically promoted; keeping the source in Go and re-converting (or using explicit interfaces) is the maintainable path.

## Interfaces
Go interfaces are duck-typed: a type implements an interface simply by having the methods. The converter emits each **user-defined** interface as a partial interface with a `[GoType]` attribute, and the **`ImplementGenerator`** source generator discovers which concrete types satisfy it and emits the implementing glue plus the implicit conversions. As a result, assigning a concrete value to an interface variable is direct — no reflection lookup or `.As(...)` call is needed:

```go
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

type point struct{ x, y int }

func (p point) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("(%d, %d)", p.x, p.y)
}

func describe() Stringer {
    return point{1, 2}    // point implements Stringer -> assignable directly
}
```
```csharp
[GoType] partial interface Stringer {
    @string String();
}

[GoType] partial struct point {
    internal nint x, y;
}

[GoRecv] internal static @string String(this ref point p) {
    return fmt.Sprintf("(%d, %d)"u8, p.x, p.y);
}

internal static Stringer describe() {
    return new point(1, 2);   // implicit conversion emitted by ImplementGenerator
}
```

The well-known built-in interfaces (`error`, `fmt.Stringer`, etc.) are hand-written in `golib`/the baseline rather than `[GoType]`-generated, but concrete types implement them the same duck-typed way. (Earlier strategies used a generic `As`/reflection mechanism; that has been superseded by the compile-time source generators.)

Each discovered "concrete type implements interface" pairing is recorded as an assembly-level attribute in the package's `package_info.cs`, e.g. `[assembly: GoImplement<point, Stringer>]`, which `ImplementGenerator` consumes. Two rules govern how these are emitted:

* **Only impl types declared in the *current* package are recorded.** `ImplementGenerator` realizes the attribute by emitting a `partial struct <Impl> : <Interface>` into the **current package's** namespace and class — so it can only add an interface to a type defined in the *same assembly*. A pairing whose impl type is *imported* from another package (e.g. `image/color/palette` building `[]color.Color{ color.RGBA{…} }`) is therefore **not** re-emitted in the consumer: that relationship is already established in the impl type's own package (`image/color` records `[assembly: GoImplement<ΔRGBA, Color>]`). Re-emitting it in a consumer would generate a broken cross-assembly partial (a fresh empty `palette_package.ΔRGBA` rather than the real `color_package.ΔRGBA`), so the converter skips any pairing whose impl type is not local.
* **Multi-segment interface references are root-qualified.** The `GoImplement` attributes are emitted before the file's `namespace` with only `using go;` in scope; that directive imports the *types* of namespace `go` (so a top-level `io_package.Writer` resolves unqualified) but **not** its nested namespaces. A multi-segment package class such as `container.heap_package.Interface` is therefore root-qualified to `go.container.heap_package.Interface` so it resolves; single-segment refs (`io_package`, `sort_package`) are left unchanged.

## Pointers
Pointer conversions use the golib heap box [`ж<T>`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/%D0%B6.cs) (read "zhe"). Taking the address of a value uses the address-of operator `Ꮡ` (e.g. `Ꮡx`); an escaping local is allocated via `heap(...)`, and addresses of a struct field or array element are taken through `.of(Type.ᏑField)` / `.at<T>(index)`:

```csharp
ref var a = ref heap(new array<@string>(2), out var Ꮡa);  // escaping local
var p = Ꮡa.at<@string>(0);                                 // &a[0]
var pField = Ꮡsettings.of(settingsᴛ1.ᏑRetries);            // &settings.Retries
```

**A heap-boxed *range variable*** needs the box allocated **per iteration**. When a `for i := range s` (or `for _, f := range s`) variable has its address taken, it escapes — but the foreach already declares that name, so a single `ref var i = ref heap(…)` before the loop would clash (CS0136). The converter iterates a *temp* and, inside the body, allocates a fresh box each pass and copies the temp into it:

```go
for i := range s {
    p := &i      // i escapes
    use(p)
}
```
```csharp
foreach (var (iᴛ1, _) in s) {
    ref var i = ref heap(new nint(), out var Ꮡi);   // a FRESH box each iteration
    i = iᴛ1;
    var p = Ꮡi;
    use(p);
}
```

The per-iteration box is required for Go 1.22 loop-variable semantics: each iteration's variable is distinct, so a stored `&i` must point to a different box each pass (`for i := range s { ptrs = append(ptrs, &i) }` yields `0 1 2`, not `2 2 2`). A non-escaping companion variable still declares directly in the foreach. (Guarded by the `RangeVarHeapBox` behavioral test — both a within-iteration `&i` and the stored-pointer distinctness case; runtime exercises it in `for i := range stackpool` and `for _, f := range s.Fields`.)

The `at<T>(index)` element-address accessor takes a `nint` index. Go permits **any** integer type as an array/slice index and converts it to `int` for the access, but C# has no implicit `nuint`/`uint`/`ulong`→`nint` conversion, so a non-`int` index is narrowed explicitly to match Go's index-to-int conversion (CS1503 otherwise). An `int` index, or an untyped int constant (which renders as a plain int literal), is emitted as-is:

```csharp
var pi = Ꮡa.at<nint>((nint)(i));        // &a[i]      where i is a uintptr
var pe = Ꮡa.at<nint>((nint)(g % 2));    // &a[g%2]    where g is a uint (g%2 widens to long in C#)
```

This is the element-address analogue of the indexed-literal key cast (`SparseArray<T>`, above) and the `IBinaryInteger<T>` width-agnostic length params on `unsafe.Add`/`Slice`/`String`. (Guarded by the `ArrayWideIndexAddress` behavioral test.)

The address of a **slice** element uses the call form `Ꮡ(slice, index)` (golib overloads `Ꮡ<T>(IArray<T>, int)` and `(…, nint)`) rather than `at<T>`. Go `int` (→ `nint`) and the small integer types that implicitly widen to `int` bind directly, but an unsigned-32-or-wider or 64-bit index (`uint`/`uint32`/`uint64`/`uintptr`/`int64`) binds neither overload, so it is cast to `int`: `Ꮡ(s, (int)(i))`. Only those wide/unsigned types are cast — an `int`/`nint` or small-int index is emitted as-is to avoid churn. (Mirrors the runtime's `&datap.pclntable[funcoff]` / `&filetab[fileoff]`, indexed by `uint32` offsets. Guarded by the `ElementAddressUnsignedIndex` behavioral test.)

**Address of an element of an array *field* reached through a pointer or boxed struct.** When the array being indexed is a field of a heap-boxed value — `&mp.future[i]` where `mp` is a `*memRecord`, or `&g.future[i]` where `g` is an address-taken global — the *array field's* address goes through the box-field accessor first, then the element index: `Ꮡmp.of(memRecord.Ꮡfuture).at<cycle>(i)` (pointer parameter), `mp.of(...)` (pointer local), `Ꮡg.of(rec.Ꮡfuture).at<cycle>(i)` (boxed global). A naive `Ꮡ` prefix on the field read (`Ꮡ(~mp).future`) instead binds `.future` to the box value `Ꮡ(~mp)` (a `ж<memRecord>`, which has no `future` member) → CS1061. This requires a matching golib detail: `ж<T>.at<TElem>(index)` resolves the array through the `val` property, **not** the raw `m_val` field — for a field-reference pointer produced by `of(...)`, `m_val` is an empty default and the real array lives behind `val` (the same resolution `of(...)` itself uses). Reading `m_val` would miss the array → null-deref at runtime even though the C# compiled. (`array<T>` is a readonly struct over a shared backing `T[]`, so the value `val` yields still aliases the real elements; writes through the returned element pointer land.) (Guarded by the `PointerFieldArrayElementAddress` behavioral test — pointer parameter and pointer local both taking `&p.future[i]` and mutating through it.)

The `at<E>(i)` **element type `E` is rendered fully-qualified** — `at<sync.atomic_package.Int32>`, not the file-local alias `at<atomic.Int32>`. A namespace-rooted type resolves inside `namespace go;` without any `using <pkg>` alias, whereas the alias form needs the file to import that package. A file can index a cross-package-typed array field of a struct without ever naming the element type (so Go requires no import, and the converter emits no `using atomic`), which would leave the alias unresolved (CS0246, e.g. runtime's `tracecpu.go` indexing `trace.cpuLogWrite`). A current-package or basic element renders identically either way, so this is churn-free. (Guarded by the `ArrayOfCrossPackageType` behavioral test's `&x.c[i]` element-address case.)

Using `ж<T>` rather than the C# `ref` keyword avoids the escape-analysis complications of passing a `ref` into code that expects a heap-allocated pointer. This is a simplification that can cost an unnecessary heap allocation when an address is taken; a future escape-analysis pass could keep such values on the stack when it is provably safe, similar to how [Go does this](https://golang.org/doc/faq#stack_or_heap) at compile time.

> Note: a package-level global whose address is taken is backed by a real heap box so that writes through `&global` (and `&global.field`) are observed, rather than mutating a copy.

### Capturing the address of a heap-boxed local in a closure
A local whose address is taken (`&m`) is heap-boxed: the converter emits `ref var m = ref heap(new T(), out var Ꮡm)`, where `Ꮡm` is the box and `m` is a `ref`-local alias of `Ꮡm.val`. When a **function literal captures such a local and takes its address inside the closure**, the variable must be referenced through the box, not snapshot-copied. A C# `ref`-local cannot be captured by a lambda (CS8175), and the older snapshot capture (`var mʗ1 = m;`) is wrong twice over: it copies the *value* out of the box (so writes through the captured `&m` are lost), and the copy declaration is a statement that has nowhere valid to land when the literal sits in an expression position — e.g. a func literal passed as a **call argument** (`run(func(){ use(&m) })`) or a local initializer (`f := func(){ use(&m) }`).

The fix: a heap-boxed local whose address is taken inside a lambda is marked *box-ref* and the snapshot is suppressed. The box `Ꮡm` is a plain local (a capturable reference), so the C# closure captures it by reference — matching Go's capture-by-reference semantics. Inside the closure the converter then renders every form through the box:

```csharp
ref var m = ref heap(new box(), out var Ꮡm);
run(() => {
    set(Ꮡm);                       // &m  → Ꮡm
    Ꮡm.val.y = Ꮡm.val.x + 1;       // value use of m → Ꮡm.val
});
// &m.field (value struct field) → Ꮡm.of(box.Ꮡfield)
```

This also covers `&m.field` (a value-struct field address inside the closure: `Ꮡm.of(box.Ꮡfield)`). The detection is scoped to the bare `&m` and value-struct `&m.field` forms (the ones with a box-ref emission form); an element address `&m[i]` keeps the existing snapshot path. The behavioral test `FuncLitArgCapture` guards the call-argument, value-use, field-address, and initializer cases.

A **deref'd pointer parameter or pointer receiver** captured by a closure is box-ref'd the same way, even when only its *value* is used inside the closure (not its address). Such a parameter is emitted as the box `ж<T> Ꮡp` with `ref var p = ref Ꮡp.val`, and the `ref`-local alias cannot be captured (CS8175). Inside the closure a value use becomes `Ꮡp.val.field` and an address use `Ꮡp`, so the closure captures the box by reference — matching Go capturing the pointer. (Guarded by the behavioral test `PointerParamCapturedInClosure`; the runtime captures `*maptype` / `*m` parameters this way pervasively.)

A pointer **receiver** captured by a closure needs an extra step the parameter case does not: the box `Ꮡp` only exists if the method is emitted **direct-ж** (the box passed *as* the receiver, `this ж<T> Ꮡp`). A normal pointer-receiver method is `[GoRecv] this ref T p` (a value-ref receiver, with the `ж<T>` companion generated separately), which has no box for the closure to reference. So "the receiver is referenced inside a function literal" is a **direct-ж trigger** — a fourth one alongside taking a field's address (`&p.field`), returning the receiver (`return p`), and using the receiver as a bare pointer value (`p.next = p`, `p != q`). Mirrors runtime's `func (p *_panic) nextFrame() { systemstack(func(){ … p.lr … }) }`. A closure parameter that shadows the receiver name resolves to a distinct object, so it does not falsely trigger the promotion. (Guarded by the `ReceiverCapturedInClosure` behavioral test — receiver captured by an immediately-invoked closure that reads/writes through it, by one that takes a field's address, and by one that is *returned* so the box must outlive the call.)

Once a method is direct-ж, its receiver is the box `Ꮡc`, but the deref'd value alias `ref var c = ref Ꮡc.val` is what most uses see. When such a receiver is passed **whole** as a pointer argument — `stackcache_clear(c)` in `func (c *mcache) prepareForSweep()` — the argument must be the box `Ꮡc`, not the value alias `c` (a value cannot bind a `ж<mcache>` parameter → CS1503). A deref-aliased pointer *parameter* is already handled (it is an `identIsParameter`), but a direct-ж *receiver* is not a parameter, so the call-argument conversion recognizes it explicitly and emits the box. (Guarded by the `DirectBoxReceiverPassedWhole` behavioral test.)

**Reassigning a pointer parameter to a new pointer.** A `*T` parameter that walks memory by reassignment — `bits = addb(bits, n)` (a `*byte` step in the runtime's bitmap scanners) or `p = p.next` (a list walk) — cannot write through its value alias: `ref var bits = ref Ꮡbits.val` makes `bits` the pointed-to *value*, and a pointer RHS (`ж<byte>`) does not fit it (CS0266/CS0029). The reassignment instead repoints the **box** and re-aliases the value var — `Ꮡbits = addb(Ꮡbits, n); bits = ref Ꮡbits.val;` — reusing the same box-reassignment path that handles a direct-ж receiver's `r = r.prev` (the RHS already emits the box form). (Guarded by the `PointerParamWalk` behavioral test, a circular-list walk that reassigns the parameter and reads the pointed-to value each step.) **Known limitation:** this is correct for a *value-using, never-nil* walk (pointer arithmetic, or a circular list — the runtime's actual patterns). A **nil-terminated** pointer-parameter walk (`for p != nil { p = p.next }`) is not yet fully modeled: the loop guard `p != nil` still compares the *value* alias rather than the box `Ꮡp`, and the re-alias `p = ref Ꮡp.val` would dereference a nil box. Reassigning a *pointer local* (not a parameter) is unaffected — a local already holds the box.

A **package-level global** referenced inside a closure is *not* captured at all — it is a C# static, accessed live. A value snapshot (`var gʗ1 = g`) would copy the struct (so `&gʗ1` has no box → CS0103, and writes through the global from inside the closure would be lost) and is semantically wrong, since Go reads/writes the live global. For an address-taken (heap-boxed) global the closure references the static box `Ꮡg` directly — a method call routes as `Ꮡg.method()` and a field address as `Ꮡg.of(T.Ꮡfield)`. (Guarded by `GlobalCapturedInClosure`; the runtime does this in every `systemstack(func(){ … mheap_ … })`.)

### Capture-mode methods called through a value field of the receiver
A pointer-receiver method that takes the address of one of its own fields (`func (c *Counter) Add(d int32) int32 { return bump(&c.n, d) }`) is *capture-mode*: it is emitted with the heap box **as** its receiver (`this ж<Counter> Ꮡc`) so `&c.n` can field-reference the real storage as `Ꮡc.of(Counter.Ꮡn)`. When another struct embeds such a type as a **value field** and drives it through that field — `func (f *Flag) Incr() int32 { return f.c.Add(1) }` — the call needs a `ж<Counter>` aliasing the real `f.c`. The enclosing method is therefore itself promoted to capture-mode (direct-ж), and `f.c.Add(1)` is emitted as `(&f.c).Add(1)`:
```csharp
public static int32 Incr(this ж<Flag> Ꮡf) {
    ref var f = ref Ꮡf.val;
    return Ꮡf.of(Flag.Ꮡc).Add(1);   // f.c.Add(1) — nested field-address box
}
```
The nested `Ꮡf.of(Flag.Ꮡc).of(Counter.Ꮡn)` chain resolves each level through `ж<T>.val` (which honors a parent that is itself a field/array reference), so writes land on the real embedded field rather than a copy. A plain (non-capture) value method called through the same field — `f.c.Get()` — is left as a normal `f.c.Get()` value call.

This field-address routing applies only to **value** fields. When the field is itself a **pointer** — e.g. cpuProfile's `log *profBuf`, accessed as `cpuprof.log` where `cpuprof` is a heap-boxed global — its C# value is *already* a `ж<profBuf>` box, so a direct-ж method binds to it directly: `cpuprof.log.close()`. Taking the field's address (`Ꮡcpuprof.of(cpuProfile.Ꮡlog)`) would double-box to `ж<ж<profBuf>>` (CS1929). The heap-boxed-receiver routing recognizes that a field selector or indexed element whose own type is a Go pointer is already a box and skips the `&`-machinery for it. This discriminates a pointer *field* of a boxed global (already a box) from a deref'd pointer *parameter* (`s` in `s.Prev()`, a value alias whose box is `Ꮡs`): the latter is a bare identifier, not a selector/index, so it is correctly still routed through `Ꮡs`. The same exclusion applies when the pointer field is reached through a pointer **local** rather than a boxed global — `s := sl.mspan; s.gcmarkBits.bytep(…)` where `s` is a `*mspan` local — which otherwise routed through the pointer-local-field address path (`s.of(mspan.ᏑgcmarkBits)`); the field value `(~s).gcmarkBits` is already the `ж<gcBits>`. (Guarded by the `PointerFieldOfBoxedGlobal` behavioral test, covering both the boxed-global `cpuprof.log.write`/`.close` form and the pointer-local `s.log.push` form; runtime exercises both pervasively, e.g. `mspan.sweep`.)

The same applies when the value field belongs to a **package global** rather than a receiver — `ctrl.total.Add(5)` where `var ctrl controller` and `total` is an atomic field. The method's box address goes through the field-address machinery, `Ꮡctrl.of(controller.Ꮡtotal).Add(5)`, not a bare `Ꮡ` prefix on `ctrl.total` (which would bind to the box variable `Ꮡctrl`, whose value type has no `total` member → CS1061). This is the form runtime uses pervasively for `gcController`, `sched`, `memstats`, etc. The **method call itself** triggers heap-boxing the global: when a pointer-receiver method is called on a (possibly nested) value field of a package value global, the escape pass marks that global address-taken so its box exists — the call site needs the box even when the global is never explicitly `&`-addressed elsewhere. This is gated on the method being ж-only (a pointer receiver): a same-package method known to be capture-mode, **or** any pointer-receiver method whose package's capture-mode set is not locally available — the latter covers cross-package atomic methods (`func (x *Uint32) Store`), which are likewise emitted with only a box receiver, so a plain value/ref of the field cannot bind them (CS1929). The walk to the global root bails at any pointer hop (a field reached through a pointer already has a real address and is handled by the pointer-local / receiver paths), so a receiver/parameter field such as `f.c` is never disturbed. (Guarded by the `AtomicValues` behavioral test's global-atomic-field case; runtime exercises this for `prof.signalLock`, `trace.seqlock`, `scavenge.gcPercentGoal`, etc.)

It also applies when the receiver is an **indexed element** of such a field — `trace.stackTab[i].dump()` (boxed global) — where the element's address goes through the box-field accessor: `Ꮡ(trace.stackTab, i).dump()` for a slice field, or `Ꮡtrace.of(T.ᏑstackTab).at<E>(i).dump()` for an array field. The same routing covers an indexed element of an array/slice reached through a **pointer** — `bh.val[i].Load()`, where `bh` is a pointer and the element is an atomic value — emitted `bh.of(T.Ꮡval).at<E>(i).Load()`. This is gated on the called method being **direct-ж** (a box receiver): an ordinary `[GoRecv] ref` method binds to an addressable element directly, so it is left as `container[i].method()` and only a direct-ж method (which truly needs the box) is routed — avoiding needless churn on the common case. (Guarded by the `IndexedElementDirectBoxMethod` behavioral test — a direct-ж method on an array-element-through-a-pointer-parameter, with mutation persistence verified; runtime hits this on `mprof`'s `bh.val[i].Load()`/`.StoreNoWB()`.)

And it applies when the field belongs to a **pointer local** — `h.s.inc()` where `h` is a `*holder` local and `inc` has a pointer receiver. A pointer local holds the box `ж<holder>` directly, so the value `~` dereference of the field (`(~h).s`) is an rvalue; the `[GoRecv]` method needs an addressable receiver (CS1510 on the generated `ref`). The field's box address is taken instead — `h.of(holder.Ꮡs).inc()` — binding the `ж` overload. (A pointer *parameter* is deref-aliased to a value, so `p.s.inc()` already works without this and is left alone. This is the form runtime uses for `(*c).gp.set(…)` / `.cas(…)` in coro.)

Finally, the same rvalue problem occurs when the field belongs to a pointer reached through *another field* — `o.h.wait.add(…)` where `o.h` is a `*holder` field and `wait` is a value (atomic) field. `o.h` dereferences to an rvalue, so `(~o.h).wait` is not addressable. The receiver is routed through the box-field accessor `o.h.of(holder.Ꮡwait)`, which aliases the **real** field storage — *not* a `Ꮡ(value)` copy, which compiles but silently boxes a copy so the atomic write is lost (a behavioral bug, not a compile error). Both the explicit address form (`&o.h.wait`) and a pointer-receiver method call on the field are routed this way. This is deliberately scoped to a base that is itself a *field selector*: a bare-ident base is the method's own receiver or a deref'd pointer *parameter* (both emitted as an addressable `ref`, so `f.c.Get()` binds directly — routing them through `&` would emit `Ꮡf.of(…)` but a value-ref receiver has no `Ꮡf` box) or a pointer *local* (handled above). (Guarded by the `AtomicFieldThroughPointer` behavioral test — a mutate-then-read proves the real field is updated, not a copy; runtime exercises this for atomic fields reached through pointer chains such as `sgp.g.selectDone.CompareAndSwap` and `gp.m.mLockProfile.recordLock`.)

### Converting a Go pointer to `unsafe.Pointer`
`unsafe.Pointer` is the golib class `unsafe_package.Pointer : ж<uintptr>` (a numeric address wrapper). A `uintptr`/`unsafe.Pointer` argument converts through the implicit `uintptr ↔ Pointer` operators, but a **Go pointer** argument (`*T`, emitted as the managed box `ж<T>`) has no such conversion — a plain cast `(@unsafe.Pointer)(ж<T>)` is `CS0030` (when `T` is unrelated to `uintptr`) or a runtime `InvalidCastException` (the base→derived downcast `(@unsafe.Pointer)(ж<uintptr>)` compiles but the object is a plain `ж<uintptr>`, not a `Pointer`). So `unsafe.Pointer(ptr)` for a pointer `ptr` is emitted through the golib helper that pins the pointed-to storage:
```go
func (u *UnsafePointer) Load() unsafe.Pointer { return Loadp(unsafe.Pointer(&u.value)) }
```
```csharp
public static @unsafe.Pointer Load(this ж<UnsafePointer> Ꮡu) {
    ref var u = ref Ꮡu.val;
    return (uintptr)Loadp(@unsafe.Pointer.FromRef(ref (Ꮡu.of(UnsafePointer.Ꮡvalue)).val));
}
```
> The resulting numeric address is **not GC-stable** — the same caveat that applies to every `unsafe.Pointer`-as-`uintptr` use; the runtime intrinsics that consume it (e.g. `Loadp`, `StorepNoWB`) are assembly stubs, so this conversion is about producing compilable C#, not GC-correct pointer arithmetic. (The reinterpret pattern `*(*U)(unsafe.Pointer(&x))` is handled separately and is not affected.)

The unsafe builtins `unsafe.Add`, `unsafe.Slice`, and `unsafe.String` accept a length/offset of **any integer type** (Go's `IntegerType` constraint, which includes `uintptr`/`uint`). golib's implementations therefore take a generic `IBinaryInteger` length, truncated to the `int` offset — so `unsafe.Slice(p, uintptrLen)` binds without an explicit cast (a plain `nint` parameter rejected a `uintptr`/`uint` argument with CS1503). (Guarded by `UnsafeBuiltinIntegerLen`.)

Passing an `unsafe.Pointer` **argument to an `unsafe.Pointer` parameter** keeps the `@unsafe.Pointer` struct value — `add(p, x)`, not `add(p.val, x)`. The struct is an exact match for the parameter. Passing its inner `uintptr` (`p.val`) instead would convert implicitly to *both* the `@unsafe.Pointer` parameter and any same-named method's `ж<T>` overload (golib defines `uintptr ↔ Pointer` and `uintptr ↔ ж<T>`), making the call ambiguous (CS0121) — e.g. the runtime free function `add(unsafe.Pointer, uintptr)` versus the `(*notInHeap).add(uintptr)` method's generated `ж<notInHeap>` extension. (Guarded by `UnsafePointerArgPassing`.)

## Implicit Pointer Dereferencing
In Go, pointer types automatically dereference; these `age` assignments are equivalent:
```go
var s struct{ age int }
var ps = &s
(*ps).age = 20
ps.age = 20
```
This also applies to receiver methods — a value-receiver method works on the type *and* on a pointer to it. In practice, the converter handles implicit dereferencing of a pointer parameter by binding a `ref` local to the box's value. For example:
```go
func PrintValPtr(ptr *int) {
    fmt.Printf("Value available at *ptr = %d\n", *ptr)
    *ptr++
}
```
becomes:
```csharp
public static void PrintValPtr(ж<nint> Ꮡptr) {
    ref var ptr = ref Ꮡptr.val;

    fmt.Printf("Value available at *ptr = %d\n", ptr);
    ptr++;
}
```

A pointer **local** that holds a `ж<T>` box (e.g. `x := list.head`, where `head` is a `*node`) dereferences on field access through the box — a read becomes `(~x).field` and a write `x.val.field = …`. This applies to **promoted** fields too: when `T` embeds another struct, a selector naming an embedded field (`x.next` where `next` is promoted from an embedded header) must still dereference. The converter decides this by checking field membership recursively through embeds, so a promoted-field access on a pointer local is not left as a bare `x.next` on the box (which has no such member, CS1061). This mirrors the Go runtime's `scanstack`, which walks `x := state.head; … x.nobj` where `nobj` is promoted into `stackObjectBuf` from an embedded header.

When the field access is the **LHS of an assignment** and the chain is *nested* — `o.stack.hi = …` where `o` is a pointer local and `stack` is a value-struct field — every dereference in the base must use the assignable `.val` form, not `~`: `(~o).stack` yields a value (an rvalue), so assigning to a field through it is not a variable/property (CS0131). The converter propagates the assignment context down the selector chain, emitting `o.val.stack.hi = …`. This mirrors runtime/cgocall.go's `g0.stack.hi = sp + 1024` where `g0` is a `*g` local.

The same applies to **`++`/`--`** on a field reached through a pointer local — increment/decrement reads *and* writes its operand, so `(~mp).ncgocall++` (a field of an rvalue) is CS1059. The converter emits the assignable `mp.val.ncgocall++`.

## Break / Continue Labels
Go restricts a label to immediately precede the enclosing statement (e.g. a `for`). Equivalent behavior is produced with a placed label and a `goto`:

### Break Label
```go
OuterLoop:
    for i = 0; i < n; i++ {
        for j = 0; j < m; j++ {
            switch a[i][j] {
            case nil:
                state = Error
                break OuterLoop
            }
        }
    }
```
becomes (the label is emitted as `break_OuterLoop:`):
```csharp
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            switch (a[i][j].type()) {
            case nil:
                state = Error;
                goto break_OuterLoop;
            }
        }
    }
break_OuterLoop:;
```

### Continue Label
```go
RowLoop:
    for y, row := range rows {
        for x, data := range row {
            if data == endOfRow {
                continue RowLoop
            }
            row[x] = data + bias(x, y)
        }
    }
```
becomes (`continue_RowLoop:` placed at the end of the loop body):
```csharp
    foreach (var (y, row) in rows) {
        foreach (var (x, data) in row) {
            if (data == endOfRow) {
                goto continue_RowLoop;
            }
            row[x] = data + bias(x, y);
continue_RowLoop:;
        }
    }
```

## Source Generators
Several Go semantics cannot be written directly in C#, so the converter emits compact, attributed partial declarations and lets a set of Roslyn source generators (`src/gen/go2cs-gen/`, referenced as an analyzer by every converted project) synthesize the rest at compile time. This keeps the visible converted code close to the Go original. The principal generators and attributes:

* **`TypeGenerator`** — driven by `[GoType]`. Emits the body of a converted type: a struct's members and equality, a named numeric/slice/array/map/channel type's wrapper and operators (see [Untyped Constants and Named Numeric Types](#untyped-constants-and-named-numeric-types) and [Slices and Arrays](#slices-and-arrays)), and struct-embedding field/method promotion.
* **`ImplementGenerator`** — wires up Go's duck-typed [interfaces](#interfaces): finds the concrete types that satisfy each `[GoType] partial interface` and emits the implementation glue and implicit conversions.
* **`RecvGenerator`** — emits pointer-receiver overloads for receiver methods (`[GoRecv]`), so a method written against a value (`this ref T`) is also callable through the pointer/box form.
* **`ImplicitConvGenerator`** — emits the implicit conversion operators that let a [named type](#type-definitions) and its underlying types be used interchangeably.
* **`PartialStubGenerator`** — emits a throwing `partial` implementation for any bodyless `partial` method that has no other implementing part (e.g. assembly/cgo functions with no convertible body), while leaving real hand-written companion implementations untouched.

Common attributes the converter emits for the generators (and tooling) to consume: `[GoType]` (type bodies), `[GoRecv]` (receiver methods), `[GoTag]` (struct field tags), `[GoPackage]` (package info), and the test-only `[GoTestMatchingConsoleOutput]`.

{

    // Each call to New returns a distinct error value even if the text is identical.
    public static error New(@string text) {
        return new errorString(text);
    }

    // errorString is a trivial implementation of error.
    [GoType] partial struct errorString {
        public @string s;
    }

    [GoRecv] internal static @string Error(this ref errorString e) {
        return e.s;
    }
}
```
