# go2cs Roadmap

Companion to [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). The path from "loop stalled" to a converted Go standard
library that compiles, passes its upstream tests, and has working C# implementations for its
assembly-backed declarations. Sequenced **green the loop first**, then compile, validate, and complete
the full conversion.

> **Status (2026-07-10): Phases 0–3 done — the full standard library compiles.** All **302** packages of
> the `src/go-src-converted` auto-conversion (Go 1.23.1) build clean as .NET assemblies (commit `51ba5d9cf`,
> tag `stdlib-green-2026-07-10`) — the Phase-3 milestone. **Compiling, not yet operational:** Phase 4 will
> convert and run Go's own package tests; Phase 5 will use those tests to prove the C# implementations that
> replace assembly/cgo stubs.

## Phase 0 — Documentation ✅ done

Orientation docs so any task starts informed: [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md),
[`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md), [`Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md`](Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md),
this file; plus a refresh of `README.md`.

## Phase 1 — Restore the separation (repo surgery) ✅ done

Goal: `src/core` = compiling baseline; `src/go-src-converted/` = full WIP; `golib` shared.

- Tagged the full conversion (`full-conversion-2025-05` → `cc14584c7`).
- Relocated the auto-generated stdlib out of `src/core` into `src/go-src-converted/` (2604-file rename);
  rewrote csproj/sln refs; added `.gitignore` rules for the Go `debug`/`log` package name collisions.
- Scoped `src/go2cs.sln` to the baseline; added `src/go-src-converted.sln` for the WIP.
- Fixed `deploy-core.bat` (`gocore`→`core`). `convert-gosrc.*` retarget still pending.

## Phase 2 — Green the loop ✅ done (via stub restore)

**Outcome:** rather than green the full `fmt` closure bottom-up (57 packages incl `runtime`/`syscall`/`os`),
we **restored the old hand-finished stub** (`3426298eb`) into `src/core` — it compiles cleanly against
today's `golib`, so the test loop went green immediately. Plus several converter fixes (below). The
57-package-closure analysis below is retained as context for **Phase 3** (the full conversion).

### How the baseline-restore path worked

The behavioral tests reference `golib` + the `go2cs-gen` analyzer + a few stdlib projects (`fmt` mostly,
plus `time`/`unsafe`/`strings`/`sort`/`math/rand`/`io`). The **stub** `fmt` is a minimal proxy with a tiny
closure (errors, io, strings, sync, math, …) — it avoids the runtime substrate, which is why restoring it
is the fast path to green. Restored 14 packages; excluded the stub `testing` (drifted, unused by tests).

### The full-`fmt`-closure path (NOT taken for the baseline; relevant to Phase 3)

The behavioral tests reference `golib` (all 59) + the `go2cs-gen` analyzer (all) + a few stdlib projects:
`fmt` (55 tests), `time` (5), `unsafe` (3), `strings` (1), `sort` (1), `math/rand` (1), `io` (1).

But these pull a **transitive dependency closure**. `fmt` alone references:
`errors, internal/fmtsort, io, math, os, reflect, slices, strconv, sync, unicode/utf8` (and those pull
more). So "green the loop" means **green `fmt`'s closure**, bottom-up.

1. **Compute closure + order.** Reuse `stdLibConverter.go`'s topological `sortedQueue`, restricted to the
   baseline roots, to get a leaf-first build order (`unsafe`, `internal/abi`, `unicode/utf8`, `math/bits`,
   … up to `fmt`).
2. **Green packages bottom-up.** For each package in order: `dotnet build` against current `golib`; fix the
   **converter** (preferred) — or, for genuinely out-of-band pieces like `builtin`, the **runtime** — until
   it compiles. Crib from the `go2cs-stub-ref` worktree when a hand-finished prior approach helps.
3. **Lock it in with a regression test.** Each greened package gets a behavioral/compile test so it stays
   green (mirrors the "raw code vs target file" comparison mode noted in `src/go2cs/ToDo.md`).
4. **Exit criterion.** Baseline `src/core` builds clean **and** all 59 `src/Tests/Behavioral` projects pass.
   The converter-improvement loop is restored.

### Phase 2 findings (measured 2026-06-25)

- **`fmt`'s closure is 57 packages** — the *full* `fmt` pulls in the entire runtime substrate
  (`runtime`, `syscall`, `os`, `reflect`, and a deep `internal/*` tree), unlike the old 36-line stub `fmt`.
- **Baseline build status: 18 / 57 compile clean** out of the box (built in place in `go-src-converted`
  against current `golib`). The pipeline works; failures are concentrated converter defects, not intractability.
- **Prioritized converter-defect roadmap** (own-errors across a probe of failing leaf/mid packages):
  | Count | Code | Meaning | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 48 | CS0106 | invalid modifier (`static readonly` on a function-local named-type const) | **FIXED** — `visitValueSpec.go`, verified math/bits 16→0 |
  | 20 | CS1002 | `;` expected | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS1519 | invalid token in member declaration | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS1026 | `)` expected | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS1003 | syntax error, X expected | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS0051 | inconsistent accessibility (param type less accessible) | open |
  | — | CS0103 | missing package-level lookup tables (e.g. `ntz8tab`/`pop8tab` in math/bits) | open |
- **Converter-improvement loop (proven end-to-end):** edit `src/go2cs/*.go` → `go build` (Go 1.23.1) →
  re-transpile → `dotnet build`. (For behavioral tests the harness runs this loop itself — see
  [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) "Test-harness mechanics".)
- **Retarget detail:** the stdlib converter writes to **`<go2cspath>/core/<pkg>`** (hardcoded `core` subdir).
  To regenerate cleanly into `src/go-src-converted`, point `-go2cspath` accordingly or convert to a temp dir
  and move. Batch several converter fixes, then do one wholesale reconvert + re-measure.

### Converter fixes landed (2026-06-25)

Each verified by rebuild + reconvert + compile:
- `golib/UntypedInt` missing semicolon (CS1002) — blocked the whole runtime.
- `static readonly` on a function-local named-type const → emit a plain local (CS0106) — `visitValueSpec.go`.
- Multi-line type-constraint unions rendered with only the first line commented → collapse to one comment
  line (`visitInterfaceType.go`).
- `~[]E` slice constraint wrongly given `IEqualityOperators` — `*Slice`/`*Array` cases were backwards and an
  empty constraint-type set counted as a subset of every operator set (`constraintOperations.go`).
- Switch fallthrough case with a single pattern value emitted an unbalanced `)` (`visitSwitchStmt.go`).
- Negative typed const (`int8 = -1`) promoted to `GoUntyped` because the range check used `ParseUint`
  (rejects negatives) → also try `ParseInt` (`visitValueSpec.go`).

## Phase 3 — Drive the full conversion to compile ✅ done (2026-07-10)

**Outcome:** all **302** packages of `src/go-src-converted` (the full Go 1.23.1 standard-library
auto-conversion) compile clean as .NET assemblies — zero errors, zero exclusions — reached 2026-07-10
(commit `51ba5d9cf`, tag `stdlib-green-2026-07-10`). `runtime`, `reflect`, `net/http`, `go/types`,
`crypto/tls`, `database/sql` and every other package are included. Every fix was root-caused against real
emitted C#, locked in by a Go-vs-C# behavioral regression test (371 and counting), and verified byte-for-byte
against the full corpus before landing. **Compiling is the milestone, not operational** — running each
package's own tests is Phase 4. The narrative of the two-week finishing campaign is in the README's
[About Standard Library Compile Milestone](README.md#about-standard-library-compile-milestone) section
(the announcement itself is archived in [`NEWS.md`](NEWS.md)); the strategy that got there is below, followed by the early iteration
log (retained as historical record — its dated "Next:" items are long since done).

The original Phase-3 plan:

1. **Build-error roadmap.** Convert + `dotnet build` `src/go-src-converted/`, capture `build.log`; bucket
   compile errors by **frequency** and by **Go feature**. This is the prioritized work queue (the README
   already frames this log as the road map).
2. **Fix by error class, bottom-up the full DAG.** Highest-frequency converter defects first (each fix
   clears many packages). Re-convert, re-bucket, repeat. **Measure by packages-compiling and error-count**,
   never by "conversion succeeded."
3. ~~**Promote, don't fork.** When a full package compiles cleanly and matches behavior, promote it toward
   the baseline; `golib`'s hand-written core stays shared and never auto-overwritten. Track promotions
   here.~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-01):** promotion `go-src-converted → core` is **deferred to post-Go-test
   (Phase 4)** and may not be needed at all. Compiling ≠ operating; a clean compile is NOT a promotion
   trigger. `core` stays the bootstrap **stub**. The hand-owned `[module: GoManualConversion]` / `*_impl.cs`
   files live in `core` and are copied **back** into `go-src-converted` (the real final state). See
   [`Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md`](Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md) *The corrected end-state* and its
   contract rules 4–5. `golib`'s hand-written core stays shared and never auto-overwritten.

### Phase 3 iteration 1 — converter fixes landed (2026-06-25)

Measurement workflow used (no wholesale commit of `go-src-converted`; it stays regenerable):
reconvert the stdlib to a temp dir (`go2cs -stdlib -comments -go2cspath <tmp>` — always `-comments` so the
Go authors' BSD license header survives; output lands in `<tmp>/core/<pkg>`),
overlay the fresh `.cs` onto `src/go-src-converted/<pkg>` (keeping the relocated csprojs, or regenerating
them and rewriting `$(go2csPath)core\` → `$(go2csPath)go-src-converted\` except `core\golib`), then
`dotnet build src/go-src-converted.sln` and bucket. Single packages build with
`-p:go2csPath=<repo>\src\` so the `$(go2csPath)` golib ref resolves outside the solution.

Four converter defects fixed (each verified by reconvert + compile of an affected package; **behavioral
suite stays green: 216/216**):

| Defect | Symptom (top error class) | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Variadic of a **type parameter** (`func Or[T any](v ...T)`) emitted a namespace-level `using ꓸꓸꓸT = Span<T>` alias — `T` out of scope | CS0246 `'T' not found` | `visitFuncDecl.go`: when the variadic element is a `*types.TypeParam`, emit `params Span<T>` inline (C# 13 params-collections) instead of the alias. |
| Go built-in **`comparable`** constraint emitted as bare `comparable` (golib's type is generic `comparable<T>`) | CS0305 `requires 1 type argument` | `main.go` `getGenericDefinition`: special-case `comparable` → `comparable<T>`. |
| **Bodyless** (assembly/cgo) funcs emitted as accessibility-modified `partial` methods with no implementing half | CS8795 (49) — biggest cluster | `visitFuncDecl.go`: emit a non-partial throwing stub (`=> throw new NotImplementedException(...)`) until an asm/cgo backend exists. |
| **Filename build-constraint over-exclusion**: `isFileNameCompatible` treated *any* unknown `_word` suffix (e.g. `bits_tables.go`, `bits_errors.go`) as a failing platform tag, silently dropping the file → missing symbols | CS0103 (`pop8tab`/`ntz8tab`/`divideError`…) | `directiveOperations.go`: only a trailing recognized `_GOOS`, `_GOARCH`, or `_GOOS_GOARCH` constrains the build (full GOOS/GOARCH name tables added); descriptive suffixes impose no constraint. |

The filename fix is the highest-impact: a full reconvert went from **1472 → 1660 emitted `.cs` files** (~188
previously-dropped stdlib source files now converted). That raises the raw error count (144 → 224) because
newly-included files surface their own latent defects — so **track packages-compiling, not error count**,
this phase.

### Phase 3 iteration 2 — `internal/cpu` address-of-field (2026-06-25)

`internal/cpu/cpu_x86.cs` owned ~140 of the syntax errors, all from `&cpu.X86.HasADX` (address of a field
of the anonymous-struct package global `X86`). Two stacked bugs, both fixed; **behavioral suite stays green
216/216**:

| Bug | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The anonymous struct type of `X86` is lifted to `X86ᴛ1` while visiting `cpu.go`, but `liftedTypeMap` is **per-file** (each file gets its own concurrent `Visitor`), so `cpu_x86.go` couldn't resolve it — `getExprTypeName` fell back to the raw struct text, mangled to `cpu.CacheLinePad}` | syntax errors (`)`/`;` expected …) | New **package-level shared registry** (`packageDynamicTypeNames`, signature→C# name) populated by `visitStructType` for package-level lifts; `convUnaryExpr` emits a marker for unresolved anonymous structs, resolved after the file-visit barrier (`dynamicTypeOperations.go`, `main.go`). Race-free: resolution runs post-`Wait()`. |
| With the name fixed, `&X86.HasADX` emitted `ᏑX86.of(…)` (identifier form), assuming a heap-boxed pointer companion — but a package-global value var has none | CS0103 `ᏑX86 does not exist` | `convUnaryExpr`: choose the address-of form by escape state — `isHeapBoxedExpr` (mirrors the existing escape check) → `Ꮡvar.of(…)` for escaping locals, else the constructor form `Ꮡ(value).of(…)` (consistent with the existing whole-value `&global` path). |

Result: `internal/cpu` went **~140 → 8 errors**. Caveat: `Ꮡ(value)` heap-allocates a *copy* (golib
`Ꮡ<T>(in T)`), so `&global.field` currently points into a copy — a pre-existing whole-category limitation
(`&global` already did this on line 124); the proper fix is **boxed companions for package-global vars whose
address is taken** (future work).

### Phase 3 iteration 3 — `internal/cpu` compiles clean (2026-06-26)

The remaining 8 `internal/cpu` errors are fixed — **`internal/cpu` is the first full-conversion stdlib
package to compile clean** (was the ~140-error blocker). Three general fixes, all behavioral-green (228/228);
re-transpiling all 61 behavioral projects left every golden byte-identical (no converter-output regression),
and the whole solution rebuilds clean against the changed golib:

| Defect | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Large untyped constant typed by value-range as `(nint)…L` even in an unsigned context (`cpuid(0x80000000, 0)`) | CS1503 `nint → uint` (×6) | `convBasicLit`: in the `> int32` branch, if the literal's contextual type is unsigned (`isUnsignedType` via `info.Types`), emit an unsigned C# literal (`2147483648U` / `…UL`). |
| Slicing an `@string` returned `slice<byte>`, so `field[:4] != "cpu."` was `slice<byte> != string` | CS0019 | **golib**: `@string this[Range]` now returns `@string` (Go string slicing yields a string). Runtime-only — no `.cs` change. |
| Empty-string literal in a tuple assignment emitted `""u8` (a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` ref struct) — illegal as a ValueTuple element | CS9244 | `visitAssignStmt`: suppress the u8 form for string literals in a multi-value (tuple) RHS (`field, env = env, ""`). |

Guarded by the `StringSliceAndUnsignedConst` behavioral test.

### Phase 3 iteration 4 — address-of-global correctness (2026-06-26)

`Ꮡ(value)` heap-allocates a **copy**, so `&global` / `&global.field` pointed into a copy — mutations never
reached the global (e.g. `internal/cpu.doinit` set feature flags on a throwaway copy of `X86`). Fixed by
backing **address-taken** package-global vars with a heap box, so the pointer references the original:

- New `globalAddressOperations.go`: a synchronous **pre-pass** (`collectAddressedGlobals`) scans all files for
  `&g` / `&g.field` / `&g[i]` rooted at a package-level var → `packageAddressedGlobals` (cross-file, since the
  global may be declared in one file and addressed in another).
- `visitValueSpec`: an addressed global is emitted as a box + ref-property —
  `static ж<T> ᏑG = new(default(T)); static ref T G => ref ᏑG.Value;` — instead of `static T G;`. Reads/writes of
  `G` are unchanged (the ref-property forwards to the box). Only address-taken globals are boxed; everything
  else keeps the plain field, so the blast radius is tiny (only `GlobalStructFieldPointers` re-transpiled).
- `convUnaryExpr` / `isHeapBoxedExpr`: for an addressed global, emit the identifier form `ᏑG` (the box) rather
  than `Ꮡ(G)` (a copy). `&X86.HasADX` → `ᏑX86.of(X86ᴛ1.ᏑHasADX)`.

`internal/cpu` still compiles clean and now mutates the real `X86`. Behavioral green; `GlobalStructFieldPointers`
strengthened to assert the global itself is mutated (would print `false/0` before the fix).

**Known limitation:** cross-package `&otherPkg.ExportedGlobal` isn't boxed (only globals addressed within
their own package are detected).

### Phase 3 iteration 5 — anonymous-struct global declarations (2026-06-26)

A package-global var whose type is inferred from an anonymous-struct composite literal
(`var S = struct{…}{…}`) emitted the raw `struct{…}` text as its C# declaration type
(`public static struct{A int; B int} S = new Δtype(…);`) — invalid C#. The value was lifted to a named type
but the declaration wasn't (the lifting happened inside the composite literal, *after* the declaration type
name was resolved). Fix in `visitValueSpec`: for a package global with an inferred anonymous-struct type, lift
the struct with the var name **before** resolving the declaration type (mirroring the explicit-type path), so
both the declaration and the value share one lifted name (`Sᴛ1`). This also unblocks **boxing** such globals,
so addressed anonymous-struct globals (`&S.field`) now work too. Behavioral green; zero existing goldens
changed (no behavioral test had an anonymous-struct global). Guarded by an extension to the `AnonymousStructs`
test (a package-global anonymous-struct var, read and mutated through a field pointer).

### Phase 3 iteration 6 — TypeGenerator CS0051 (unexported embedded marker) (2026-06-26)

A public struct embedding an unexported marker type as a blank field (`_ noCopy`, the
`sync/atomic.Bool` pattern) made the **`TypeGenerator`** (Roslyn) emit `public Bool(noCopy _)` —
a public constructor whose parameter type `noCopy` is `internal` → CS0051. Root cause:
`GetScope("_")` returns `"public"` (the `firstChar == '_'` rule), so the blank embedded field
was classified as a public member and drove the public ctor. Fix in `StructTypeTemplate.PublicStructMembers`:
exclude blank/underscore-prefixed fields (never exported in Go) from the public constructor. All CS0051
in `sync/atomic` cleared; behavioral green (232/232 + the new test). Guarded by `UnexportedEmbeddedMarker`.

### Phase 3 iteration 7 — asm-function companion source generator (2026-06-26)

Resolves the iteration-6 follow-up. Bodyless (asm/cgo) Go functions are once again emitted by the converter
as `partial` *declarations* (reverting iteration-1's non-partial throwing stub). A new **`PartialStubGenerator`**
(`go2cs-gen`) emits a throwing `partial` *implementation* for every bodyless `partial` method that has **no**
other implementing part in the compilation (`IMethodSymbol.PartialImplementationPart is null`). So:
- packages that ship a hand-written companion (`sync/atomic`'s `doc_impl.cs`, real `Interlocked` bodies) use
  those bodies — the generator detects the impl and skips them; and
- companion-less packages (`crypto/internal/boring/sig`, `crypto/subtle`, …) get a generated throwing stub,
  so they compile instead of CS8795/CS0111.

**`sync/atomic` now compiles clean** — the second full-conversion stdlib package to go green (after
`internal/cpu`). `sig` compiles too. Behavioral suite stays green (the generator is a no-op for the tests —
none contain asm functions; zero behavioral `.cs` changed). Not behaviorally testable (Go rejects a bodyless
function without an `.s` file), so verified via the full-conversion packages compiling.

### Phase 3 — promotion gate finding: `sync/atomic` typed API is broken (2026-06-26)

A behavioral validation test (atomic ops, Go-vs-C# output, referencing `go-src-converted/sync/atomic`)
was written as the gate before promoting `sync/atomic` to the baseline. **It failed, and that is the
point — "compiles" ≠ "correct".** The package-level functions (`atomic.AddInt32(&n, 3)`) work, but the
**typed atomic types are broken**: `var i atomic.Int32; i.Store(10); i.Add(5); i.Load()` yields `0` in C#
instead of `15` (Go).

Root cause: a method like `func (x *Int32) Store(v) { StoreInt32(&x.v, v) }` converts `&x.v` (address of a
field of the **pointer receiver**) to `Ꮡ(x.v)`, which **boxes a copy** (the `ж(in T)` ctor copies), so the
atomic op never touches the real field. Attempting the fix uncovered a deep stack of issues in the
**receiver-capture mechanism**, which is the only way to get a non-copying pointer to a receiver field:
1. `&recv.field` must use the captured receiver box (`Ꮡx.of(Type.ᏑField)`), not `Ꮡ(x.field)` — and the
   detection has to run *before* the struct-field gate (a pointer receiver's selector type is a pointer).
2. The capture field name (`<Method>ꓸᏑx`) **collides** across overloaded same-named methods on different
   receiver types (`Int32.Add`, `Int64.Add`, …) — needs the receiver type in the name (converter + generator).
3. The capture field is a **static `ThreadLocal`** on the (non-generic) package class, so it **cannot hold a
   generic receiver's `T`** (`atomic.Pointer[T]`).
4. Even fixed, the `ThreadLocal` is only initialized when the method is called via the `ж` (pointer) overload;
   a value-receiver-style call (`i.Store(10)`) routes through the `ref` overload and the capture is **never
   initialized** (runtime "Receiver target … is not initialized").

**Conclusion:** `sync/atomic` is **not promotable** — its primary API doesn't work, and the receiver-field
address / capture machinery needs a substantial rework (likely replacing the static-`ThreadLocal` capture
with something that works for value calls and generic receivers). `internal/cpu` likewise isn't promotable
(asm `cpuid` is a stub). Promotion stays **pull/validation-driven**; this gate correctly blocked it.

### Receiver-field address / capture rework — staged (2026-06-26)

Making `&recv.field` reference the real receiver field (the `sync/atomic` typed-type unlock). Split into two
stages:

- **Stage A — DONE (commit `36363ef16`, behavioral green 236/236).** `convUnaryExpr` emits the captured-box
  field-ref form (`<capturedName>.of(Type.ᏑField)`) for `&recv.field` on a non-generic pointer receiver (the
  detection must run *before* the struct-field gate, since the receiver's selector type is a pointer). The
  captured-receiver field name is made unique per receiver type (`<Method>_<RecvType>ꓸᏑx`) so it doesn't
  collide across overloaded same-named methods (`Int32.Add`, `Int64.Add`, …) — coordinated in the converter
  (`getCapturedReceiverName`) and the generator (`ReceiverMethodTemplate`).
- **Stage B — DONE (commit `9aeaf29e2`, behavioral green 236/236).** Value-receiver calls of capture-mode
  methods now route through the `ж` overload so the captured form references the real field:
  - `captureModeOperations.go` — a pre-pass (`collectCaptureModeMethods`) scans the package **and its
    transitive imports** (`LoadAllSyntax` provides dep ASTs) for non-generic pointer-receiver methods taking
    `&recv.field`, keyed by the interned `*types.Func` so cross-package call sites match;
  - `escapeAnalysisOperations.go` — a value var on which a capture-mode method is called is marked escaping
    (heap-boxed), so its `Ꮡname` companion exists;
  - `convSelectorExpr.go` — the call is routed through the `ж` overload (`Ꮡi.Store(10)`).
  Also fixed an **inverted `CompareAndSwap`** in the hand-written `sync/atomic` companion (`doc_impl.cs`):
  `Interlocked.CompareExchange` returns the original, so a swap succeeded iff `== old` (was `!= old`) — found
  by the validation test. **Result: `sync/atomic`'s scalar typed types (`Int32/64`, `Uint32/64/ptr`, `Bool`)
  now work end to end** — `var i atomic.Int32; i.Store(10); i.Add(5); i.Load()` → 15, CAS/Swap/etc. all match
  Go. Guarded by the self-contained `ReceiverFieldAddress` behavioral test (no `go-src-converted` dependency).
- **Generic receivers (direct-`ж`) — DONE.** Generic capture-mode receivers (`atomic.Pointer[T]`) are now
  emitted with the heap box **as the receiver** (`this ж<Box<T>> Ꮡx` + `ref var x = ref Ꮡx.Value;`), and
  `&x.field` field-refs through the box parameter (`Ꮡx.of(Box<T>.ᏑField)`) — `T` stays in scope, no static
  field needed. `[GoRecv]` is suppressed automatically (the signature is `this ж<…>`, not `this ref …`, so
  `RecvGenerator` skips it and there is no duplicate overload). Value calls heap-box and route through the ж
  overload (the Stage-B escape/routing already handles this once the generic methods are included). Converter
  changes: `captureModeOperations.go` (new `packageDirectBoxReceiverMethods`, keyed by `*types.Func.Origin()`
  so instantiated call sites match), `visitFuncDecl.go` (un-skip the receiver deref + emit `ж<T>` receiver),
  `convUnaryExpr.go` (generic branch → `Ꮡx.of(...)`), and `main.go` `getFullTypeName` (append type args for
  instantiated **cross-package** generics, else a boxed `atomic.Pointer[Config]` emits `new …Pointer()` with
  no `<Config>`). Validated by the **`GenericReceiverFieldAddress`** behavioral test (a generic `Box[T]`
  with `Set`/`Get` taking `&b.v`, exercised for `int` and `string`); behavioral suite green, zero churn.
- **Direct-`ж` extended to ALL field-address capture methods — fixes a concurrency bug.** The non-generic
  capture path used a static `ThreadLocal<ж<T>>` field reassigned per call (`new ThreadLocal<…>(() => Ꮡx)`),
  which is a **shared static** — concurrent calls on *distinct* receivers race on that field, so e.g.
  `u0.Load()` can return `u6`'s value (proven by an 8-thread stress test: each thread Loads its own
  `atomic.Uint32`, sees another's). Broken precisely for the concurrent types atomics exist for, and invisible
  to the single-threaded behavioral suite. Fix: `captureModeOperations.go` now marks *every* `&recv.field`
  capture method (generic **and** non-generic) direct-`ж`, so the box is the receiver parameter — no shared
  state, and alloc-free. `convUnaryExpr.go` always emits `Ꮡx.of(...)`; `visitReturnStmt.go` returns `Ꮡrecv`
  for a direct-box method (keeps a method that both takes `&recv.field` and returns the receiver consistent).
  Re-ran the stress test → "no race observed". `core/sync/atomic/type.cs` scalars re-emitted to direct-`ж`
  (the file is `GoManualConversion`, so re-emitted by hand from a reconvert, keeping the managed `Pointer<T>`).
  Guarded by the `AtomicValues` test; only the `ReceiverFieldAddress` golden changed (intended, still correct).
- **Return-receiver capture converted too, and the ThreadLocal mechanism DELETED.** The other capture trigger
  — `func (t *T) Common() *T { return t }` (`internal/abi`) — now also emits direct-`ж` (`captureModeOperations.go`
  `bodyReturnsReceiver` marks it direct-box; `visitReturnStmt.go` returns `Ꮡrecv`). With **both** triggers on
  direct-`ж`, nothing emits `[GoRecv("capture")]` anymore, so the whole racy mechanism is dead and was removed:
  converter (`captureReceiver` field, `getCapturedReceiverName`, the `[GoRecv("capture")]` emission) and
  generator (`ReceiverMethodTemplate`'s `CapturePointer`/`CaptureName`/`CaptureDeclarations`/`CaptureOperation`
  + the `ThreadLocal` `using`, and `RecvGenerator`'s now-unused `Options` arg) — ~55 lines gone, generated `ж`
  overloads are now a clean deref+delegate. Baseline `core/internal/abi/type.cs` `Common` surgically updated to
  direct-`ж` (promotion overloads regenerate correctly); `StdLibInternalAbi` golden updated. Full solution green;
  32/32 capture-affected behavioral phases pass; stress test still "no race observed". There is now **one** way
  a pointer-receiver method captures its box (the `ж<T>` parameter) — no thread-local, no shared state.
- **`sync/atomic` PROMOTED to `core` — first stdlib package migrated.** `src/core/sync/atomic` is now in the
  green baseline (`go2cs.slnx`, `/core/` folder), referencing `core/unsafe` + `core/golib`. Scalar typed
  types are the converter output as-is; `Pointer[T]` is **hand-rewritten** in the promoted (hand-owned) copy.
  - **The `unsafe.Pointer` finding (why the rewrite, not a global fix).** `unsafe.Pointer` is a type **alias
    to `nuint`** (`[assembly:GoTypeAlias("@unsafeꓸPointer","nuint")]`) — a raw number — used across **171
    files / ~1522 `ж↔uintptr` sites** in the full conversion, almost all *legitimately* numeric (pointer
    arithmetic, syscall, reflect). In .NET a managed reference **cannot** be stored as a number and survive a
    GC move (CLR rule), so golib's `ж↔uintptr` operators (`ж.cs:449-458`) can't round-trip a managed `ж<T>`:
    the zero case NREs (`*(T*)0`) and a real case dangles (a `fixed`-pin address read after the block closes).
    A *global* `unsafe.Pointer` redesign would be reckless (huge blast radius, breaks the correct numeric
    uses), so the contained fix lives in the one type that stores a managed pointer.
  - **The managed `Pointer<T>` (`core/sync/atomic/type.cs`).** Field `v` is a managed `ж<T>` (not
    `@unsafe.Pointer`); `Load`/`Store` use `Volatile.Read/Write`, `Swap`/`CompareAndSwap` use
    `Interlocked.Exchange`/`CompareExchange<ж<T>>`. A `nilCanon` helper collapses an explicit nil-`ж` to
    `null` so reference-based CAS treats every nil pointer as equal (matching Go's `nil == nil`). No
    `unsafe.Pointer`, GC-safe, nil-safe.
  - **Validated** end to end: `atomic.Pointer[int]`/`[Config]` Load/Store/Swap/CAS + the scalar API all match
    Go. Guarded by the **`AtomicValues`** behavioral test (scalar `Int32` + generic `Pointer[int]`, both
    paths). Solution builds green; behavioral suite green (zero churn).
  - **csproj gotcha:** `core/sync/sync.csproj` had no subfolder exclusion (it never had one); adding
    `core/sync/atomic` made it swallow atomic's generated files (`CS0579`). Fixed by mirroring `math.csproj`'s
    `<Compile Remove="rand\**" />` pattern → `<Compile Remove="atomic\**" />`.
- ~~Promote `internal/cpu` and `sync/atomic`~~ — atomic gated on the `unsafe.Pointer`/`ж` representation
  above (scalars work, `Pointer[T]` runtime-broken); cpu gated on asm `cpuid`.
- Confirm `internal/cpu` / `sync/atomic` build within the full
  `go-src-converted.sln` alongside their dependents.
- Re-bucket after a fresh full reconvert to find the next highest-frequency converter defect.

### Phase 3 iteration 8 — re-bucket + 4 converter/generator fixes (2026-06-26)

Fresh full reconvert (305 pkgs, 1659 `.cs`) + full `go-src-converted.sln` build, re-bucketed by `CS####`
frequency. **Measurement gotcha caught:** the reconvert-overlay must NOT blanket-delete `.cs` first — ~15
hand-written companion/pseudo-package files (`unsafe/unsafe.cs`, `*_impl.cs`, generator companions) are not
regenerated by the converter, and deleting them produces a phantom ~120-error `unsafe_package` CS0246 bucket.
Overlay by copying generated `.cs` over; `git checkout --` any deletions.

After clearing the phantom bucket, the real own-error defects bucketed as: reflectlite (24, CS1537 dup
`global using`), container/list (6→25 post-fix) + container/ring (12) sharing one `ж<T>` defect, unicode (4),
internal/types/errors (4), plus runtime/unsafeheader-missing-ref cascades. Four fixes landed (behavioral
suite green throughout; zero existing goldens changed by any):

| Defect | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Generator dup `global using`** — `GetFullyQualifiedUsingStatements` (all 5 generators) copied `global using` alias directives from the source file as file-local `using`, colliding with the in-scope global one | CS1537 (×24 in reflectlite, via `PartialStubGenerator` asm stubs) | `go2cs-gen/Common.cs`: skip `global using` directives (already in scope everywhere, generated files included). reflectlite 24→0. Not behaviorally testable (asm-stub-only path); verified via the full conversion. Commit `9c9431b3f`. |
| **Mixed-type for-init** — `for i, e := s.Len(), s.Front()` (int + pointer) emitted two `;`-separated decls inside the C# for-init clause (invalid: the `;` ends the clause); the combined `var (a,b)` form is blocked by the int special-casing | CS1002/CS1003 (container/list + ~20 files) | `visitAssignStmt.go` (+ `forInit` flag in `FormattingContext`/`visitForStmt`): emit a tuple-deconstruction declaration with per-element types — `(nint i, var e) = (...)`. Gated on all-new, non-heap-boxed LHS. Guarded by `ForInitMixedTypes`. Commit `6d339a3d0`. |
| **Variadic-of-pointer param** — `func In(r rune, ...*RangeTable)` emitted an invalid using alias `ꓸꓸꓸж<RangeTable> = Span<…>` (alias identifier can't contain `<`/`>`) | CS1002/CS1022 (unicode) | `visitFuncDecl.go`: emit `params Span<T>` inline when the element type is generic/pointer (`Contains "<"`), extending iteration-1's type-parameter special case. |
| **Empty/spread variadic-of-pointer call** — `In(r)` (no trailing args) panicked the converter (`Args[i]` indexed past end); `f(slice...)` emitted `Ꮡslice` (element address-of applied to the spread slice) | converter panic → dropped file; CS0103 | `convCallExpr.go`: guard the element-pointer arg treatment with `paramHasArg` (empty call) and `!(hasSpreadOperator && last param)` (spread). |

The last two ship together with the `VariadicPointerParam` behavioral test (args/empty/single/spread calls).

### Phase 3 iteration 9 — blank-identifier collision (CS0102) (2026-06-26)

A package declaring blank `_` constants (skipping `iota` values) **and** a blank `func _()` (the stringer
compile-time-assertion idiom — e.g. `internal/types/errors`) emitted multiple `internal static readonly … Δ_`
fields that collided: CS0102 "already contains a definition for 'Δ_'". Root cause: `performNameCollisionAnalysis`
recorded `_` in both the named-element set (the blank consts) and the method-name set (`func _()`), flagged it
as a const↔method collision, and `getSanitizedIdentifier` Δ-prefixed every `_` to the same `Δ_` — defeating
the value-spec visitor's per-blank unique naming (`_ᴛNʗ`). Fix (`nameCollisionAnalysisOperations.go`): exclude
the blank identifier from collision analysis (it is a discard, never referenced, and already gets unique names).
internal/types/errors CS0102 4→0 (remaining: a `strconv` project-ref, separate). Guarded by `BlankIdentifierCollision`;
behavioral suite green, zero existing goldens changed. **Found-but-deferred:** a bare discard `_ = expr` *inside*
a `func _()` emits `_ = …` which binds to the method group → CS1656 ("cannot assign to '_'") — a separate edge
case (real stringer asserts use `_ = x[C-C]`); not hit by internal/types/errors' actual body.

### Phase 3 iteration 10 — accurate re-bucket + pointer-copy fix (2026-06-26)

**Measurement-methodology finding (important):** the committed `go-src-converted` csprojs are stale and lack
inter-package `ProjectReference`s that the *current* converter emits correctly. Overlaying fresh `.cs` onto those
stale csprojs inflated the bucket with phantom CS0246 "package not found". Regenerating the csprojs from the fresh
conversion (with the documented `core\`→`go-src-converted\` rewrite, golib excepted) dropped the total **95→79**
and CS0246 **23→5**. **So the measurement loop must regenerate csprojs, not keep the committed ones** — there is no
converter csproj-emission defect. Reusable overlay script: `scratchpad/overlay.sh`.

True own-defect leaders after the rewrite: container/list (25) + ring (12) = the `ж<T>` model; internal/chacha8rand
(7, mostly the same `ж<T>` pattern — `State.Init64`/`Refill` on a value needing the box); math/bits (4, unsigned-
arithmetic/shift-count coercions); a handful of 1–2-error leaves.

**The `ж<T>` model split into two sub-problems** (converter derefs a pointer param/receiver to a value alias
`ref var x = ref Ꮡx.Value`, losing pointer identity when Go uses it *as* a pointer):
- **Sub-problem B — DONE (this iteration).** `r := p` / `r = p` (pointer copy of a *T parameter) emitted `var r = p`
  (a copy of the pointed-to value); the converter already treats the walked target as a pointer (`r.Value`/`~r`), so
  it miscompiled. Fix (`visitAssignStmt.go`): a plain pointer-typed identifier on an assignment RHS now gets the
  pointer (box) form — `var r = Ꮡp` — via a new `rhsPointerCopyContext`/`appendRhsPtrContext` helper applied in both
  the declare/reassign branch and the per-variable (escaping-var) branch. A pointer *local* already holds the pointer
  directly, so it is unchanged → **zero existing behavioral goldens changed**; suite green 260/260. Guarded by the
  `PointerCopyWalk` behavioral test (copy-then-walk, for-init copy, explicit local seed).
- **Sub-problem A — TODO (the harder half).** Using the *receiver* as a pointer value — `func (n *node) selfLink() {
  n.next = n }` — still emits `n.next = n` (a value-ref receiver `this ref node n` has no box). Needs the receiver
  direct-`ж` mechanism (extend `captureModeOperations` so "receiver used as a bare pointer value" — assigned to a
  pointer field, stored, compared — triggers a `this ж<T> Ꮡn` receiver, like the existing `&recv.field`/`return recv`
  triggers). container/ring & list need **both** A and B to fully compile; B lands alone as a correctness fix.

**Other queued leaf defects** (from the 79-error bucket): plugin CS0553 (ImplicitConvGenerator emits illegal
`object↔T` conversions), runtime/internal/math CS0133/0266 (`const MaxUintptr` ulong→nuint not const), unicode
CS0051/52 (exported field of an unexported type), internal/runtime/atomic CS1526 (`new` without `()`), and the
deferred CS1656 (bare `_ = expr` discard inside a `func _()`).

### Phase 3 iteration 11 — `ж<T>` sub-problem A: receiver as a pointer value (2026-06-26)

A method that uses its pointer receiver as a bare *value* — `func (r *ring) initSelf() { r.next = r }` (assign the
receiver to a pointer field) — emitted `n.next = n`: a value-ref receiver (`this ref ring r`) has no box, so a
ring value was assigned to a `ж<ring>` field (didn't compile; would point into a copy). Fix, two parts:
- `captureModeOperations.go`: a third direct-ж trigger `bodyUsesReceiverAsPointerValue` (the receiver appears as a
  bare RHS identifier of an assignment) — alongside the existing `&recv.field` and `return recv` triggers — so such
  methods get the box-as-receiver form `this ж<ring> Ꮡr`.
- `convIdent.go`: when the receiver of a direct-ж method is used as a pointer value (its RHS context sets isPointer
  via iteration-10's `rhsPointerCopyContext`), emit the receiver box `Ꮡr` (the value-ref path has no box).

Validated by `ReceiverPointerValue` (self-link, cross-link, pointer-walk; mutating through the self-link proves the
field points at the real receiver — 42/42/3/2). Suite green 264/264, zero existing goldens changed. **Payoff:**
container/ring 12→8 errors, container/list 25→~10 (and the remainder are now *different*, narrower defects).

**Remaining `ж<T>` sub-problems** (the still-failing ring/list errors, each a distinct mechanism — follow-up work):
- **C — transitive direct-ж.** A method calling a direct-ж method on its (value) receiver, e.g. `Next`/`Prev`:
  `return r.init()` where `init` is direct-ж → `r` (a `ref Ring` value) can't call the `ж<Ring>` overload (CS1929).
  The caller must itself become direct-ж; needs a fixpoint over `bodyCallsDirectBoxMethodOnReceiver`.
- **D — reassign the receiver pointer.** `Move`'s `r = r.prev` / `r = r.next` walks the ring by repointing the
  receiver. With a direct-ж receiver `r` is `ref var r = ref Ꮡr.Value` (a value alias) → assigning a `ж<Ring>` to it
  is CS0029. Needs `Ꮡr = r.prev; r = ref Ꮡr.Value` (repoint the box, re-alias) — the receiver-pointer-reassignment case.
- **A-variant — receiver in a comparison.** `Len`/`Do`'s `for (… p != r; …)` compares a `ж<Ring>` to the value
  receiver `r` (CS0019). The comparison must emit `Ꮡr`; extend the receiver-as-pointer-value detection/emission to
  binary (==/!=) operands, not just assignment RHS.

### Phase 3 iteration 12 — container/ring + list COMPILE AND RUN; `ж<T>` identity equality (2026-06-26)

Finished the `ж<T>` self-referential-pointer model — **container/ring and container/list both compile clean**, and
(crucially) **run correctly**. Four converter pieces + one runtime fix; zero existing behavioral goldens changed:
- **A-variant** (`captureModeOperations.go`): `bodyUsesReceiverAsPointerValue` also fires when the receiver is an
  operand of a `==`/`!=` comparison (`p != r`). `convBinaryExpr` already sets isPointer on comparison operands, so
  `convIdent` then emits `Ꮡr`. (ring 8→6)
- **C — transitive direct-ж** (`captureModeOperations.go` + `convSelectorExpr.go`): a method calling a direct-ж
  method on its receiver (`return r.init()`) must itself be direct-ж. New candidate list + **fixpoint** over
  `bodyCallsDirectBoxMethodOnReceiver` (repeat until stable — the callee may only be marked in a later pass). The
  call routes through the box: `convSelectorExpr` now boxes the receiver for `exprIsCurrentDirectBoxReceiver` and
  for a deref'd pointer **parameter** (`exprIsDerefdPointerParam`, e.g. `Link`'s `s.Prev()`). (ring 6→2)
- **D — reassign the receiver pointer** (`visitAssignStmt.go`): `r = r.prev` on a direct-ж receiver emits the box on
  the LHS (`exprIsCurrentDirectBoxReceiver` + RHS-is-pointer), so the existing pointer-reassignment path produces
  `Ꮡr = r.prev; r = ref Ꮡr.Value;` (repoint + re-alias). (ring 2→0 — **container/ring compiles clean**)
- **E — chained selector through a pointer field** (`convSelectorExpr.go`): `e.list.root` / `p.next.prev` (an
  intermediate pointer field) wasn't dereferenced — the receiver/param skip-deref check used `getIdentifier(X)`,
  which digs to the *root* of the chain (`e`), so it wrongly skipped derefing `e.list`. Now it only skips when `X`
  is *directly* the receiver/param ident. (list 10→0 — **container/list compiles clean**)
- **golib `ж<T>` identity equality** (`ж.cs`): the **runtime correctness gate**. The new `RingPointerMethods` test
  *compiled* but *stack-overflowed* — `ж<T>.Equals` did pointed-to-**value** comparison, but Go pointer comparison is
  **identity**; value comparison infinitely recurses on a self-referential struct (`Ring.next *Ring`). Rewrote
  `Equals`/`GetHashCode` to compare by referenced storage (same box, same struct-field source+accessor, or same
  array+index), never the value. Correct Go semantics and recursion-free.

Guarded by the **`RingPointerMethods`** behavioral test (a full mini-ring exercising A/A-variant/B/C/D/E — build,
walk, Len, Move±, Prev — output matches Go). The golib change touches all pointer equality; validated by the full
suite. **Both container packages now compile *and* run** — closing out the general pointer-as-value problems.

### Phase 3 iteration 13 — leaf-defect sweep: 5 fixes, 3 leaves greened (2026-06-26)

Fresh full reconvert + regenerated-csproj overlay + `go-src-converted.sln` build re-bucketed the leaves: the
`ж<T>` work had cleared the big clusters, leaving **39 errors across 17 of 304 projects** (down from last
session's 79). Five fixes landed (each its own commit; all behavioral-green, zero existing-golden churn except
the one intended re-baseline noted):

| Fix | Defect | Greens | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`min`/`max` built-ins** (golib `builtin.cs`) | Go 1.21 `min`/`max` emitted verbatim but golib had no such methods → CS0103. Added generic `min`/`max` constrained to `IComparable<T>` (numeric primitives + `@string`). No converter change. | **crypto/subtle** (+ unblocks ~dozens that use the built-ins) | `daddd953d` |
| **unsafe.Pointer keyword sanitization** (`convIdent.go`) | The `name.Value` deref form for an `unsafe.Pointer` ident used the raw Go name, so a param named `new` (C# keyword) emitted `new.Value` → CS1526. Now sanitized to `@new.Value`. | (internal/runtime/atomic syntax; pkg has deeper latent ж issues) | `175e0dfd3` |
| **unsigned unary-minus + shift precedence + shift-assign count** (`convUnaryExpr`/`convBinaryExpr`/`visitAssignStmt`) | `x & -x` → CS0023 (now `(T)0 - x`); Go `x>>4 + x` / `1<<15 - 1` re-associated in C# (shift binds looser) → now shift exprs parenthesized; `y <<= s` cast count to RHS type → CS0019 (now `(int)`). | **math/bits 4→1**; corrected a *latent* `1<<15-1`→`1<<14` miscompile in the StdLibInternalAbi golden (re-baselined) | `9089b9c4b` |
| **builtin-shadowing local rename** (`variableAnalysisOperations.go`) | `len := len(buf)` — a local named like a *called* built-in shadows the `using static` method → CS0149/CS0841. Renames the local (`lenΔ1`) when that built-in is actually called in the function; built-in call stays `len`. | **hash/maphash** | `e87705650` |
| **comma-ok map access** (`convIndexExpr`/`convExpr`/`visitAssignStmt`) | `v, ok := m[k]` (+ blank, if-init, reassign forms) wasn't detected as a tuple result → indexed twice, value assigned to `ok` (CS0029). Now routed through golib's two-value indexer `m[key, ꟷ]` via a new `IndexExprContext.isTupleResult`. **High-value correctness fix** (every comma-ok map read was wrong; no behavioral test had covered it). | **internal/coverage/rtcov** | `92d832204` |

Guarded by new behavioral tests: `MinMaxBuiltin`, `UnsafePointerKeywordParam`, `ShiftPrecedenceUnsigned`,
`BuiltinShadowLocal`, `MapCommaOk`. **Leaf packages greened this iteration: crypto/subtle, hash/maphash,
internal/coverage/rtcov.** Found-but-deferred: reading a **nil map** NREs instead of yielding zero/false (golib
nil-map representation gap — a chip was filed). math/bits' last error is a local untyped `const` (`1<<32`) typed
`UntypedInt`/BigInteger in uint64 arithmetic — context-typing untyped local consts is a larger follow-up.

### Phase 3 — earlier note: the `ж<T>` self-referential-pointer-struct confusion in container/ring & container/list —
`r.next = r` (assign receiver to a pointer field → needs the box `Ꮡr`) and `r = r.prev` (reassign the Go
pointer variable, but the C# `ref var r = ref Ꮡr.Value` deref aliases the value). The deeper one (CS0019/CS1061/
CS0029/CS1929 cluster), blocking both container packages.

## Phase 4 — Convert and run Go package tests

**Goal:** validate each compiling converted package against the same `_test.go` suite used by Go before
assembly-backed implementations are attempted at scale. The detailed and authoritative design is
[`TestingInfrastructureRequirements.md`](TestingInfrastructureRequirements.md); this section tracks the
delivery sequence and exit gates.

### 🎉 First operational milestone (2026-07-12): a converted `fmt.Println("hi")` RUNS and prints

A `-recurse`-converted `fmt.Println("hi")` program builds against the full converted stdlib and prints
`hi` to stdout, byte-identical to `go run .`. Reaching it meant clearing a **ten-layer startup crash
chain** — every layer a fix committed and validated (full behavioral suite + deployed stdlib build green
at each step). This is the minimum Phase-4 operational bar. In order:

1. **Native `sync` primitives** (`e36dea3aa`) — Go's runtime sleeping semaphore cannot be emulated;
   `Mutex`/`RWMutex`/`WaitGroup` are hand-owned native rewrites on .NET primitives (see
   [DESIGN → Operational stdlib](Phase3/DESIGN-recursive-enduser-conversion.md#operational-stdlib--native-sync-primitives-2026-07-11-phase-4-start)).
2. **Package-level var initialization order** (`e39855770`) — relocate initializers whose Go dependency
   order (`types.Info.InitOrder`, resolved transitively through package function bodies) C#'s static-field
   order cannot reproduce, into a generated `package_init.cs` static ctor. First crash of any `os` import.
   Guard `PackageVarInitOrder`.
3. **Operational groundwork** (`a7ea6d3b7`, `e299253be`) — native Windows syscall FFI (`dll_windows.cs`:
   LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress + a `calli` `SyscallN` trampoline), `godebug` hooks, `runtime` bootstrap-init
   suppression (`.NET is the runtime`), `efaceOf`/`gomaxprocs` seeding, native `sync.Pool`, `SetFinalizer`
   bridge. (`runtime2.cs` marker fixup `c3f907846`.)
4. **Nested promoted-embed init** (`0bba3f5f8`, go2cs-gen) — zero-value ctors construct struct-typed fields
   whose type needs construction; first crash of `fmt.newPrinter`. Guard `NestedPromotedEmbedInit`.
5. **Pointer receiver `==`/`!=` compares its box** (`78fe56a7f`) — `os.(*File).checkValid`'s `if f == nil`.
   Guard `PointerReceiverNilCompare`.
6. **Dead pointer-param value alias skipped** (`1a723d425`) — `syscall.writeFile`'s nil `*Overlapped`
   deref-alias NRE. Guard `DeadPointerParamAlias`.
7. **golib nil pointer → address 0** (`5a4ad2b1b`) — `uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(nil))` == 0 instead of
   throwing; the final layer, reaching the OS `WriteFile`. Guard `NilPointerUintptr`.

**Next:** the `fatih/color` `-recurse` sample (exercises isatty/`GetConsoleMode` + `WriteConsole`, an
untested path — a redirected/piped stdout takes the `WriteFile` path proven above), then Go's own
`_test.go` suites (Phase 4 proper, below). Still open: dereferencing an *actually-nil* receiver/param NREs
at the deref alias (the nil-safe `DerefOrNil` accessor is not yet extended from nil-walked params to
receivers / live aliases); `time`'s runtime clock linknames.

The behavioral suite proves individual converter/runtime constructs using hand-written fixtures. Phase 4
adds the complementary whole-package gate: load Go's internal and external test-package variants, convert
the eligible tests, compile them with the converted package sources, and compare their results with a clean
`go test -json -count=1` run for the same source, build tags, GOOS, and GOARCH.

### Phase 4A — colocated test projects and serial test core

- Add an opt-in test conversion mode using `go/packages` with `Tests = true`; do not burden normal
  production-only conversion.
- Emit `x_test.go` as `x_test.cs` beside the other converted files, plus
  `<package>.tests.csproj`, `package_test_info.cs`, a deterministic test manifest, and a generated package
  test host.
- Keep the production project test-free. The test project recompiles the production `.cs` sources with
  the test sources instead of referencing the production DLL; this preserves same-package access to
  unexported declarations and joins the same partial package class.
- Support both `package p` and external `package p_test` tests in one isolated package executable,
  including external self-import binding without a self-referencing project.
- Add a hand-owned `go.testing` compatibility runtime for the initial bootstrap rather than depending on
  the full converted `testing` package. Implement the serial core: pass/fail, `Error[f]`, `Fatal[f]`,
  `FailNow`, logs, skips, helpers, cleanup, panic reporting, `TempDir`, `Setenv`, and `TestMain`/`M.Run`.
- Run every package in a child process with a controlled environment, timeout, and isolated working tree
  containing its relative fixtures and `testdata`.
- Add end-to-end behavioral fixtures for discovery, same-package unexported access, external tests,
  `TestMain`, failure/skip/panic/defer paths, cleanup order, build constraints, fixtures, and unsupported
  capabilities.

**Phase 4A exit:** all harness fixtures pass and at least one already-compiling leaf standard-library
package is validated end to end.

### Phase 4B — subtests, parallelism, and differential results

- Implement `T.Run`, hierarchical names/filtering, duplicate subtest names, cleanup after child completion,
  and `T.Parallel` with Go's parent/subtest barrier semantics.
- Emit normalized package/test events and aggregate them into machine-readable output plus JUnit or TRX for
  CI. Compare eligible test identity and terminal status with Go; do not byte-compare timings, paths, stack
  formatting, or concurrent log interleaving.
- Record every discovered test as included, platform-excluded, unsupported, or failed-to-convert. No omitted
  test may silently count as a pass.
- Detect stale manifests from source inputs, target options, converter revision, and hand-written companion
  files; unchanged conversions must be byte-stable.

**Phase 4B exit:** representative leaf packages using external tests, subtests/parallelism, and file fixtures
validate reproducibly on the matched target platform.

### Phase 4C — package coverage and CI scaling

- Work bottom-up through the compiling package DAG, expanding the compatibility API from categorized real
  failures rather than speculative reimplementation of all of `testing`.
- Track each target/package as **validated**, **failing**, **conversion-blocked**,
  **infrastructure-blocked**, or **not-applicable**.
- Add batching, CI sharding, package-level timeouts, failure artifacts, and explicit flake diagnostics.
- Keep benchmarks, active fuzzing, race-detector equivalence, and coverage-percentage equivalence outside
  the initial correctness gate. Add examples and deterministic fuzz seed corpora later without delaying
  Phase 5.

**Phase 4 exit:** one documented command converts, builds, and runs a selected package's tests; the harness
semantics are guarded end to end; every compiling package attempted is honestly classified; and at least
three representative leaf packages are validated (including external-package and subtest/parallel cases).
Only **validated** satisfies the default Phase 5 behavior gate.

### Phase 4 follow-up (deferred) — expand the `sstring` stack-string MVP

The escape-analysis-driven stack-string emission landed as a deliberately conservative **MVP** (2026-07-12,
branch `golib-string-performance`; see [`ConversionStrategies-Reference.md`](ConversionStrategies-Reference.md#a-non-escaping-stringbyte-local-emits-the-stack-string-sstring)
and the [Glossary MVP entry](Glossary.md#mvp)). It emits a zero-copy [`sstring`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/core/golib/sstring.cs)
view for a `s := string([]byte)` local only when the local is non-escaping, its source is a plain unnamed
`[]byte` never written after the conversion, and its every use is a safe read (`len`/`cap`, byte index, or
comparison against a string literal). That initial predicate fired on **exactly one** Go-1.23 stdlib site.
A first expansion has since landed (2026-07-12) — **unnamed `string(x)` comparison operands** against a
literal (`string(buf[:4]) == "ZLIB"`, `string(item) != "null"`), which are consumed within the comparison
and so need no analysis at all — lifting the stdlib footprint to **~23 sites across ~19 files** (the common
byte-signature-check idiom in `debug/*`, `encoding/json`, `image/gif`·`png`, …). Still far short of the
`PerfString` win (whose `s` is a `+` operand, so it stays `@string` and needs increment 4 below).

Expand the eligible surface further, one gated increment at a time. **Why this is well-suited to exploratory work:**
because `sstring` is a `ref struct`, the .NET compiler turns almost every over-reach into a **compile error**
(it cannot be stored in a field/array/map, boxed to an interface, sent on a channel, or captured by a
closure) — so a too-aggressive predicate fails **loud** at build time (caught by the behavioral suite +
full-stdlib reconvert), never silently. The **only** silently-wrong vectors are escape-via-`return` and
mutation of the source buffer during the view's lifetime; both must stay explicitly guarded. Candidate
increments, roughly by ROI:

1. **Unnamed-temporary conversions.** The comparison-operand slice (`string(b) == "literal"`, and now — see
   increment 3 — `string(b) == variable` and `string(a) == string(b)`) is **done**. The remaining slice —
   `string(x)` passed to a non-retaining callee (`strconv.ParseUint(string(s), …)`) or used as a map key
   (`m[string(b)]`) — is harder: a `@string`-typed parameter or map key copies the `sstring` back at the
   boundary (no win) unless the callee/`map<K,V>` gains an `sstring`/`ReadOnlySpan<byte>` overload. Needs a
   curated non-retaining-callee whitelist plus golib span-lookup support on `map`.
2. **`sstring operator+`** (returning `@string`) — **done (2026-07-13)** — plus widening the safe-use
   whitelist beyond len/cap/byte-index/compare-literal. Two widenings have landed:
   - **`switch string(x)` tag** (and a named local used as a switch tag). A Go string switch always lowers
     to a temp compared against each case label with `==` (never a C# `switch`/pattern — string labels are
     not C# case constants), so the tag is a zero-copy `sstring` view whenever every case label is a
     mutation-safe operand (literal, pure read, or another conversion — never a call). Covers the
     binary-format-detection idiom `switch string(magic) { case elfMagic: … }`
     (`markSStringSwitchConversions` + the switch-tag safe use in `sstringUsesAreSafe`).
   - **`string(x) + suffix` concatenation.** `golib`'s `sstring` gained `operator+` overloads (vs
     `@string`, `sstring`, and a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` u8 literal, both orders, all → `@string`) that
     block-copy the operand span into the single result buffer, skipping the intermediate `((@string)x)`
     copy (the RESULT `@string` still allocates — the win is one fewer allocation per concatenation). A
     `string(x)` `+` operand is emitted `sstring` under the comparison rules
     (`markSStringBinaryOperandConversions` now matches `token.ADD`; a named local's `+` use is added to
     `sstringUsesAreSafe`).

   Both guarded by `SStringElision` (switch: literal/named-local/magic-const + negative call-label;
   concat: named-local/literal/variable/two-conversion + negative call-operand); full-stdlib reconvert
   stays 302/302. Sub-slicing kept in safe uses and rune-range remain. (Increment 1's
   `for range string(x)` sub-case is **not pursued** — the Go-1.23 stdlib has zero such sites, so there
   is no footprint to justify the golib rune-enumerator surface. Increment 1's `m[string(x)]` map-key
   sub-case is **not pursued** — a zero-allocation span lookup would require replacing every
   `@string`-keyed `map`'s default equality comparer with a custom `IAlternateEqualityComparer`, whose
   virtual dispatch would slow ALL `@string` map operations — a net loss dwarfing the ~16 read-only
   sites, and writes cannot be optimized at all.)
3. **Mixed `sstring == @string`** operator — **done (2026-07-13).** `golib`'s `sstring` gained all six
   comparison operators (`==`/`!=`/`<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=`, both operand orders) against `@string`, a byte-ordinal
   `SequenceCompareTo`/`SequenceEqual` with **no** heap copy of either side. No ambiguity was reintroduced: a
   `u8` literal binds the `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` operator, an `@string` variable the new mixed operator, another
   view the `sstring == sstring` operator — each an exact match. The converter now emits `sstring` for a
   non-escaping `string(x)` compared against a plain-`string` variable/field, and for two `string(bytes)`
   conversions compared directly, both for a named local (`s := string(x); s == want`) and an unnamed operand
   (`string(x) == want`). The unnamed form additionally requires the other operand to be mutation-safe (a
   literal, pure-read expression, or another conversion — never a call, which could write `x` before the lazy
   view is read); the named-local form needs no such check because its source is already proven never-written.
   This lifted the Go-1.23 stdlib footprint substantially (the common `string(b[:n]) != magic` and
   downgrade-canary idioms across `crypto/*`, `hash/*`, `html/template`, `go/internal/*importer`, …). Guarded
   by `SStringElision` (mixed-vs-variable, mixed-vs-field, two-conversion, and a negative call-operand case);
   full-stdlib reconvert stays 302/302.
4. **Positional / loop-carried liveness guard** — relax "source never written" to "not written between the
   conversion and the local's last read, not loop-shared." This is the **only** increment that reaches the
   `PerfString` hot loop, and the highest silent-risk one — gate it behind the heaviest adversarial pass.
5. **Loop-invariant / repeated-conversion hoisting** — **done (2026-07-12).** An *optimization* of
   already-eligible sites, not a widening. When an eligible `string(x)` over a never-written identifier was
   emitted **repeatedly** — several comparisons, or the same conversion inside a hot loop — the converter
   re-materialized `(sstring)x` (`new sstring(x.ToSpan())`) at every use, and the JIT will **not** hoist it.
   This was measured, not assumed: a non-throwing `MemoryMarshal.CreateReadOnlySpan` view added to `golib` (so
   the `ToSpan` bounds check could not block loop-invariant-code-motion) made **zero** difference — the JIT
   simply does not lift a `ref struct` view out of a loop. The converter now emits **one** hoisted `sstring`
   temp at function scope and reuses it — a clean back-to-back A/B took `PerfStringView` from **4.84× → 3.04×
   Go** on the JIT (35.9 → 22.5 ms) and **4.49× → 1.86×** on Native AOT (34.4 → 14.1 ms). That is about the
   practical floor within .NET: the residual is inherent (`SequenceEqual`'s per-call setup on a tiny buffer vs
   Go's inlined `memcmp`; a decomposition micro-benchmark confirmed the `sstring` `==` operator itself adds
   **zero** over a raw span compare — the whole cost is the per-use view reconstruction).

   **Implementation** ([`sstringHoistOperations.go`](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs/blob/master/src/go2cs/sstringHoistOperations.go)):
   a per-`FuncDecl` pre-pass (`planSStringHoists`) groups eligible `string(x)` conversions **over a bare
   identifier** by that identifier's object and, when the source is a never-written function-local/parameter
   (`objectIsWritten == false`) declared before the injection point with no use inside a nested func literal,
   lifts a group of ≥2 uses (or ≥1 use in a loop) to one `sstring <temp> = ((sstring)x);` — `convCallExpr`
   returns the temp name at each use; `visitBlockStmt` injects the decl before the group's anchor (the first
   top-level body statement containing a use). The `objectIsWritten(x) == false` predicate the MVP already
   computed makes **function-top** hoisting always safe (no cross-loop mutation analysis — the safe subset of
   increment 4). The **bare-identifier** gate is load-bearing: grouping merely by *root* ident would collapse
   `string(buf[:7])` and `string(buf[8:12])` (net/http's `is408Message`, the one stdlib site an earlier draft
   wrongly hoisted) into a single incorrect view — so sub-slice / index sources stay inline.

   **Verified:** `SStringElision` extended with a loop case, a straight-line 2-use case, and the
   distinct-sub-slice case that must **not** collapse (behavioral suite green); the full-stdlib reconvert hoists
   **zero** sites and stays byte-identical to baseline (302/302, 0 errors) — confirming the ROI caveat that real
   stdlib `sstring` sites are mostly **single** comparisons where hoisting is a no-op. The idiomatic
   **named-local** form (`s := string(x)`) already hoisted (the MVP emits one `sstring s = (sstring)x`); this
   increment is a targeted win for the *inline-repeated* loop/tokenizer idiom (a scanner comparing `string(buf)`
   against several keywords), not a broad one.

Guard every increment with the `SStringElision` behavioral test (extend it) + full-stdlib reconvert (inspect
every newly-`sstring` site) + a re-run of the performance suite to quantify the actual win.

## Phase 5 — Implement assembly-backed declarations in C#

**Goal:** replace the `PartialStubGenerator`'s throwing implementations for Go declarations backed by
assembler, cgo, runtime/compiler intrinsics, or platform services with maintainable C# implementations,
proved package by package by Phase 4.

### Phase 5A — inventory and classify the external surface

- Produce a deterministic inventory of every bodyless partial declaration and generated throwing stub,
  including Go declaration/source, owning package, build constraints, target platforms, callers, and tests
  that cover it.
- Classify each member as: direct managed equivalent; .NET intrinsic/BCL primitive; platform interop;
  runtime service; intentionally unsupported target; or dead for the selected target.
- Prioritize bottom-up by dependency impact and test coverage. Start with leaf packages whose converted tests
  already run, not merely the declarations that are easiest to translate.
- Establish a per-package completion ledger linking declarations, implementation files, target support, test
  evidence, and any reviewed waiver.

### Phase 5B — declaration/implementation companion pattern

- Keep the converter-owned bodyless declaration as a `partial` method. Supply the implementation in a
  hand-owned companion such as `*_impl.cs`; when the Go source uses a declaration-oriented file, preserve
  the corresponding converted `*_decl.cs` plus `*_impl.cs` pairing. The established
  `sync/atomic` `doc.cs` + `doc_impl.cs` pattern is the model.
- Never hand-edit regenerable declaration output. The `PartialStubGenerator` remains the safe compile-time
  fallback and automatically disappears for a member once its real implementing part is present.
- Prefer behaviorally equivalent managed code (`Interlocked`, `Volatile`, `BitOperations`, spans, BCL crypto,
  etc.) over literal instruction-by-instruction assembly translation. Preserve Go overflow, alignment,
  memory-ordering, pointer/GC, and platform semantics explicitly.
- Keep platform implementations isolated by target and fail clearly for unsupported targets. Do not let a
  generic throwing stub masquerade as completed platform support.
- Add focused Go/C# behavioral fixtures when upstream tests do not directly exercise a declaration or an
  important boundary condition.

### Phase 5C — validate, promote, and close the stub inventory

For each implemented package:

1. reconvert production and tests from clean inputs;
2. confirm the production and test projects compile without a generated stub for the implemented members;
3. run the matched Go test baseline and converted C# suite;
4. require all eligible relevant tests to pass, with no silent exclusions;
5. run focused stress/edge tests for concurrency, atomics, unsafe pointers, cryptography, or platform calls
   where ordinary unit tests are insufficient; and
6. promote/update the baseline only after the evidence is recorded in the package ledger.

Compilation alone is not completion. If a package's tests cannot yet run, it stays
**infrastructure-blocked** or **conversion-blocked**; any platform-specific waiver must be explicit and
reviewed.

**Phase 5 exit:** for every supported target, the external-declaration inventory has no unexplained throwing
stubs; each implemented member has a real companion or a documented target exclusion; all applicable
packages are Phase 4 **validated**; and the full converted standard-library test run passes for the supported
package/target matrix.
