# go2cs Roadmap

Companion to [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). The path from "loop stalled" to "full Go stdlib converts and
compiles." Sequenced **green the loop first**, then drive the full conversion.

> **Status (2026-06-25): Phases 0–2 done — baseline is green.** `go2cs.sln` builds 79/79; behavioral suite
> passes (216 tests). Phase 3 (the full conversion) is the remaining work.

## Phase 0 — Documentation ✅ done

Orientation docs so any task starts informed: [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md),
[`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md), [`Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md`](Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md),
this file; plus a refresh of `README.md`.

## Phase 1 — Restore the separation (repo surgery) ✅ done

Goal: `src/core` = compiling baseline; `src/go-src-converted/` = full WIP; `golib` shared.

- Tagged the full conversion (`full-conversion-2025-05` → `cc14584c7`).
- Relocated the auto-generated stdlib out of `src/core` into `src/go-src-converted/` (2604-file rename);
  rewrote csproj/sln refs; added `.gitignore` rules for the Go `debug`/`log` package name collisions.
- Scoped `src/go2cs.sln` to the baseline; added `src/go-src-converted.sln` for the WIP.
- Fixed `deploy-core.bat` (`gocore`→`core`). `convert-gosrc.*` retarget still pending.

## Phase 2 — Green the loop ✅ done (via stub restore)

**Outcome:** rather than green the full `fmt` closure bottom-up (57 packages incl `runtime`/`syscall`/`os`),
we **restored the old hand-finished stub** (`3426298eb`) into `src/core` — it compiles cleanly against
today's `golib`, so the test loop went green immediately. Plus several converter fixes (below). The
57-package-closure analysis below is retained as context for **Phase 3** (the full conversion).

### How the baseline-restore path worked

The behavioral tests reference `golib` + the `go2cs-gen` analyzer + a few stdlib projects (`fmt` mostly,
plus `time`/`unsafe`/`strings`/`sort`/`math/rand`/`io`). The **stub** `fmt` is a minimal proxy with a tiny
closure (errors, io, strings, sync, math, …) — it avoids the runtime substrate, which is why restoring it
is the fast path to green. Restored 14 packages; excluded the stub `testing` (drifted, unused by tests).

### The full-`fmt`-closure path (NOT taken for the baseline; relevant to Phase 3)

The behavioral tests reference `golib` (all 59) + the `go2cs-gen` analyzer (all) + a few stdlib projects:
`fmt` (55 tests), `time` (5), `unsafe` (3), `strings` (1), `sort` (1), `math/rand` (1), `io` (1).

But these pull a **transitive dependency closure**. `fmt` alone references:
`errors, internal/fmtsort, io, math, os, reflect, slices, strconv, sync, unicode/utf8` (and those pull
more). So "green the loop" means **green `fmt`'s closure**, bottom-up.

1. **Compute closure + order.** Reuse `stdLibConverter.go`'s topological `sortedQueue`, restricted to the
   baseline roots, to get a leaf-first build order (`unsafe`, `internal/abi`, `unicode/utf8`, `math/bits`,
   … up to `fmt`).
2. **Green packages bottom-up.** For each package in order: `dotnet build` against current `golib`; fix the
   **converter** (preferred) — or, for genuinely out-of-band pieces like `builtin`, the **runtime** — until
   it compiles. Crib from the `go2cs-stub-ref` worktree when a hand-finished prior approach helps.
3. **Lock it in with a regression test.** Each greened package gets a behavioral/compile test so it stays
   green (mirrors the "raw code vs target file" comparison mode noted in `src/go2cs/ToDo.md`).
4. **Exit criterion.** Baseline `src/core` builds clean **and** all 59 `src/Tests/Behavioral` projects pass.
   The converter-improvement loop is restored.

### Phase 2 findings (measured 2026-06-25)

- **`fmt`'s closure is 57 packages** — the *full* `fmt` pulls in the entire runtime substrate
  (`runtime`, `syscall`, `os`, `reflect`, and a deep `internal/*` tree), unlike the old 36-line stub `fmt`.
- **Baseline build status: 18 / 57 compile clean** out of the box (built in place in `go-src-converted`
  against current `golib`). The pipeline works; failures are concentrated converter defects, not intractability.
- **Prioritized converter-defect roadmap** (own-errors across a probe of failing leaf/mid packages):
  | Count | Code | Meaning | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 48 | CS0106 | invalid modifier (`static readonly` on a function-local named-type const) | **FIXED** — `visitValueSpec.go`, verified math/bits 16→0 |
  | 20 | CS1002 | `;` expected | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS1519 | invalid token in member declaration | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS1026 | `)` expected | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS1003 | syntax error, X expected | open (syntax cluster) |
  | 18 | CS0051 | inconsistent accessibility (param type less accessible) | open |
  | — | CS0103 | missing package-level lookup tables (e.g. `ntz8tab`/`pop8tab` in math/bits) | open |
- **Converter-improvement loop (proven end-to-end):** edit `src/go2cs/*.go` → `go build` (Go 1.23.1) →
  re-transpile → `dotnet build`. (For behavioral tests the harness runs this loop itself — see
  [`/CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) "Test-harness mechanics".)
- **Retarget detail:** the stdlib converter writes to **`<go2cspath>/core/<pkg>`** (hardcoded `core` subdir).
  To regenerate cleanly into `src/go-src-converted`, point `-go2cspath` accordingly or convert to a temp dir
  and move. Batch several converter fixes, then do one wholesale reconvert + re-measure.

### Converter fixes landed (2026-06-25)

Each verified by rebuild + reconvert + compile:
- `golib/UntypedInt` missing semicolon (CS1002) — blocked the whole runtime.
- `static readonly` on a function-local named-type const → emit a plain local (CS0106) — `visitValueSpec.go`.
- Multi-line type-constraint unions rendered with only the first line commented → collapse to one comment
  line (`visitInterfaceType.go`).
- `~[]E` slice constraint wrongly given `IEqualityOperators` — `*Slice`/`*Array` cases were backwards and an
  empty constraint-type set counted as a subset of every operator set (`constraintOperations.go`).
- Switch fallthrough case with a single pattern value emitted an unbalanced `)` (`visitSwitchStmt.go`).
- Negative typed const (`int8 = -1`) promoted to `GoUntyped` because the range check used `ParseUint`
  (rejects negatives) → also try `ParseInt` (`visitValueSpec.go`).

## Phase 3 — Drive the full conversion to compile (the ultimate goal)

1. **Build-error roadmap.** Convert + `dotnet build` `src/go-src-converted/`, capture `build.log`; bucket
   compile errors by **frequency** and by **Go feature**. This is the prioritized work queue (the README
   already frames this log as the road map).
2. **Fix by error class, bottom-up the full DAG.** Highest-frequency converter defects first (each fix
   clears many packages). Re-convert, re-bucket, repeat. **Measure by packages-compiling and error-count**,
   never by "conversion succeeded."
3. **Promote, don't fork.** When a full package compiles cleanly and matches behavior, promote it toward the
   baseline; `golib`'s hand-written core stays shared and never auto-overwritten. Track promotions here.

### Phase 3 iteration 1 — converter fixes landed (2026-06-25)

Measurement workflow used (no wholesale commit of `go-src-converted`; it stays regenerable):
reconvert the stdlib to a temp dir (`go2cs -stdlib -comments -go2cspath <tmp>` — always `-comments` so the
Go authors' BSD license header survives; output lands in `<tmp>/core/<pkg>`),
overlay the fresh `.cs` onto `src/go-src-converted/<pkg>` (keeping the relocated csprojs, or regenerating
them and rewriting `$(go2csPath)core\` → `$(go2csPath)go-src-converted\` except `core\golib`), then
`dotnet build src/go-src-converted.sln` and bucket. Single packages build with
`-p:go2csPath=<repo>\src\` so the `$(go2csPath)` golib ref resolves outside the solution.

Four converter defects fixed (each verified by reconvert + compile of an affected package; **behavioral
suite stays green: 216/216**):

| Defect | Symptom (top error class) | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Variadic of a **type parameter** (`func Or[T any](v ...T)`) emitted a namespace-level `using ꓸꓸꓸT = Span<T>` alias — `T` out of scope | CS0246 `'T' not found` | `visitFuncDecl.go`: when the variadic element is a `*types.TypeParam`, emit `params Span<T>` inline (C# 13 params-collections) instead of the alias. |
| Go built-in **`comparable`** constraint emitted as bare `comparable` (golib's type is generic `comparable<T>`) | CS0305 `requires 1 type argument` | `main.go` `getGenericDefinition`: special-case `comparable` → `comparable<T>`. |
| **Bodyless** (assembly/cgo) funcs emitted as accessibility-modified `partial` methods with no implementing half | CS8795 (49) — biggest cluster | `visitFuncDecl.go`: emit a non-partial throwing stub (`=> throw new NotImplementedException(...)`) until an asm/cgo backend exists. |
| **Filename build-constraint over-exclusion**: `isFileNameCompatible` treated *any* unknown `_word` suffix (e.g. `bits_tables.go`, `bits_errors.go`) as a failing platform tag, silently dropping the file → missing symbols | CS0103 (`pop8tab`/`ntz8tab`/`divideError`…) | `directiveOperations.go`: only a trailing recognized `_GOOS`, `_GOARCH`, or `_GOOS_GOARCH` constrains the build (full GOOS/GOARCH name tables added); descriptive suffixes impose no constraint. |

The filename fix is the highest-impact: a full reconvert went from **1472 → 1660 emitted `.cs` files** (~188
previously-dropped stdlib source files now converted). That raises the raw error count (144 → 224) because
newly-included files surface their own latent defects — so **track packages-compiling, not error count**,
this phase.

### Phase 3 iteration 2 — `internal/cpu` address-of-field (2026-06-25)

`internal/cpu/cpu_x86.cs` owned ~140 of the syntax errors, all from `&cpu.X86.HasADX` (address of a field
of the anonymous-struct package global `X86`). Two stacked bugs, both fixed; **behavioral suite stays green
216/216**:

| Bug | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The anonymous struct type of `X86` is lifted to `X86ᴛ1` while visiting `cpu.go`, but `liftedTypeMap` is **per-file** (each file gets its own concurrent `Visitor`), so `cpu_x86.go` couldn't resolve it — `getExprTypeName` fell back to the raw struct text, mangled to `cpu.CacheLinePad}` | syntax errors (`)`/`;` expected …) | New **package-level shared registry** (`packageDynamicTypeNames`, signature→C# name) populated by `visitStructType` for package-level lifts; `convUnaryExpr` emits a marker for unresolved anonymous structs, resolved after the file-visit barrier (`dynamicTypeOperations.go`, `main.go`). Race-free: resolution runs post-`Wait()`. |
| With the name fixed, `&X86.HasADX` emitted `ᏑX86.of(…)` (identifier form), assuming a heap-boxed pointer companion — but a package-global value var has none | CS0103 `ᏑX86 does not exist` | `convUnaryExpr`: choose the address-of form by escape state — `isHeapBoxedExpr` (mirrors the existing escape check) → `Ꮡvar.of(…)` for escaping locals, else the constructor form `Ꮡ(value).of(…)` (consistent with the existing whole-value `&global` path). |

Result: `internal/cpu` went **~140 → 8 errors**. Caveat: `Ꮡ(value)` heap-allocates a *copy* (golib
`Ꮡ<T>(in T)`), so `&global.field` currently points into a copy — a pre-existing whole-category limitation
(`&global` already did this on line 124); the proper fix is **boxed companions for package-global vars whose
address is taken** (future work).

### Phase 3 iteration 3 — `internal/cpu` compiles clean (2026-06-26)

The remaining 8 `internal/cpu` errors are fixed — **`internal/cpu` is the first full-conversion stdlib
package to compile clean** (was the ~140-error blocker). Three general fixes, all behavioral-green (228/228);
re-transpiling all 61 behavioral projects left every golden byte-identical (no converter-output regression),
and the whole solution rebuilds clean against the changed golib:

| Defect | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Large untyped constant typed by value-range as `(nint)…L` even in an unsigned context (`cpuid(0x80000000, 0)`) | CS1503 `nint → uint` (×6) | `convBasicLit`: in the `> int32` branch, if the literal's contextual type is unsigned (`isUnsignedType` via `info.Types`), emit an unsigned C# literal (`2147483648U` / `…UL`). |
| Slicing an `@string` returned `slice<byte>`, so `field[:4] != "cpu."` was `slice<byte> != string` | CS0019 | **golib**: `@string this[Range]` now returns `@string` (Go string slicing yields a string). Runtime-only — no `.cs` change. |
| Empty-string literal in a tuple assignment emitted `""u8` (a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` ref struct) — illegal as a ValueTuple element | CS9244 | `visitAssignStmt`: suppress the u8 form for string literals in a multi-value (tuple) RHS (`field, env = env, ""`). |

Guarded by the `StringSliceAndUnsignedConst` behavioral test.

### Phase 3 iteration 4 — address-of-global correctness (2026-06-26)

`Ꮡ(value)` heap-allocates a **copy**, so `&global` / `&global.field` pointed into a copy — mutations never
reached the global (e.g. `internal/cpu.doinit` set feature flags on a throwaway copy of `X86`). Fixed by
backing **address-taken** package-global vars with a heap box, so the pointer references the original:

- New `globalAddressOperations.go`: a synchronous **pre-pass** (`collectAddressedGlobals`) scans all files for
  `&g` / `&g.field` / `&g[i]` rooted at a package-level var → `packageAddressedGlobals` (cross-file, since the
  global may be declared in one file and addressed in another).
- `visitValueSpec`: an addressed global is emitted as a box + ref-property —
  `static ж<T> ᏑG = new(default(T)); static ref T G => ref ᏑG.val;` — instead of `static T G;`. Reads/writes of
  `G` are unchanged (the ref-property forwards to the box). Only address-taken globals are boxed; everything
  else keeps the plain field, so the blast radius is tiny (only `GlobalStructFieldPointers` re-transpiled).
- `convUnaryExpr` / `isHeapBoxedExpr`: for an addressed global, emit the identifier form `ᏑG` (the box) rather
  than `Ꮡ(G)` (a copy). `&X86.HasADX` → `ᏑX86.of(X86ᴛ1.ᏑHasADX)`.

`internal/cpu` still compiles clean and now mutates the real `X86`. Behavioral green; `GlobalStructFieldPointers`
strengthened to assert the global itself is mutated (would print `false/0` before the fix).

**Known limitation:** cross-package `&otherPkg.ExportedGlobal` isn't boxed (only globals addressed within
their own package are detected).

### Phase 3 iteration 5 — anonymous-struct global declarations (2026-06-26)

A package-global var whose type is inferred from an anonymous-struct composite literal
(`var S = struct{…}{…}`) emitted the raw `struct{…}` text as its C# declaration type
(`public static struct{A int; B int} S = new Δtype(…);`) — invalid C#. The value was lifted to a named type
but the declaration wasn't (the lifting happened inside the composite literal, *after* the declaration type
name was resolved). Fix in `visitValueSpec`: for a package global with an inferred anonymous-struct type, lift
the struct with the var name **before** resolving the declaration type (mirroring the explicit-type path), so
both the declaration and the value share one lifted name (`Sᴛ1`). This also unblocks **boxing** such globals,
so addressed anonymous-struct globals (`&S.field`) now work too. Behavioral green; zero existing goldens
changed (no behavioral test had an anonymous-struct global). Guarded by an extension to the `AnonymousStructs`
test (a package-global anonymous-struct var, read and mutated through a field pointer).

### Phase 3 iteration 6 — TypeGenerator CS0051 (unexported embedded marker) (2026-06-26)

A public struct embedding an unexported marker type as a blank field (`_ noCopy`, the
`sync/atomic.Bool` pattern) made the **`TypeGenerator`** (Roslyn) emit `public Bool(noCopy _)` —
a public constructor whose parameter type `noCopy` is `internal` → CS0051. Root cause:
`GetScope("_")` returns `"public"` (the `firstChar == '_'` rule), so the blank embedded field
was classified as a public member and drove the public ctor. Fix in `StructTypeTemplate.PublicStructMembers`:
exclude blank/underscore-prefixed fields (never exported in Go) from the public constructor. All CS0051
in `sync/atomic` cleared; behavioral green (232/232 + the new test). Guarded by `UnexportedEmbeddedMarker`.

### Phase 3 iteration 7 — asm-function companion source generator (2026-06-26)

Resolves the iteration-6 follow-up. Bodyless (asm/cgo) Go functions are once again emitted by the converter
as `partial` *declarations* (reverting iteration-1's non-partial throwing stub). A new **`PartialStubGenerator`**
(`go2cs-gen`) emits a throwing `partial` *implementation* for every bodyless `partial` method that has **no**
other implementing part in the compilation (`IMethodSymbol.PartialImplementationPart is null`). So:
- packages that ship a hand-written companion (`sync/atomic`'s `doc_impl.cs`, real `Interlocked` bodies) use
  those bodies — the generator detects the impl and skips them; and
- companion-less packages (`crypto/internal/boring/sig`, `crypto/subtle`, …) get a generated throwing stub,
  so they compile instead of CS8795/CS0111.

**`sync/atomic` now compiles clean** — the second full-conversion stdlib package to go green (after
`internal/cpu`). `sig` compiles too. Behavioral suite stays green (the generator is a no-op for the tests —
none contain asm functions; zero behavioral `.cs` changed). Not behaviorally testable (Go rejects a bodyless
function without an `.s` file), so verified via the full-conversion packages compiling.

### Next defects (work queue)
- **Promote `internal/cpu` and `sync/atomic`** toward the baseline, or confirm they build within the full
  `go-src-converted.sln` alongside their dependents.
- Re-bucket after a fresh full reconvert to find the next highest-frequency converter defect.
