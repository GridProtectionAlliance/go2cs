## Security

The Grid Protection Alliance (GPA) takes the security of our software products and services seriously. This includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizational sites, specifically: [Grid Protection Alliance](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance), [Gemstone Libraries](https://github.com/gemstone), and [Streaming Telemetry Transport Protocol](https://github.com/sttp).

GPA has adopted the following "[definition of security vulnerability](https://gridprotectionalliance.org/VulnerabilityDefinition.asp)" when considering what constitutes a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability meeting this definition in any GPA-owned repository, please report it to us as described below.
